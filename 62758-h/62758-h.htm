<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
MR. WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Her hands were firm and cool, and his were trembling,
trembling; but her eyes were laughing, laughing,
and his own eyes burned.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford had caught at her hands.  For a brief
moment, as one in great agony almost swoons in
ecstasy of relief at sudden cessation of the pain, he had
felt his brain swing, then float, in most exquisite calm
at the peace, at the strength their firm, cool touch
communicated to him.  Then Mr. Wriford saw the laughing
lightness in her eyes, and felt his own&mdash;whose dull,
aching burn had for that instant been slaked&mdash;burn,
burn anew; and felt beat up his brain that dreadful
rush of blood that often in these days terrified him;
and felt that lift and surge through all his pulses that
sometimes reeled him on his feet; and knew that baffling
lapse of thought which always followed, as though the
surge were in fact a tide of affairs that flung him high
and dry and left him out of action to pick his way
back&mdash;to grope back to the thread of purpose, to the train
of thought, that had been snapped&mdash;if he could!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford knew that the day was coming when he
could not.  Every time when, in the midst of ideas, of
speech, of action, the surge swept him adrift and stranded
him vacant and bewildered, the effort to get back was
appreciably harder&mdash;the interval appreciably of greater
length.  The thing to do was to hang on&mdash;hang on
like death while the tide surged up your brain.  That
sometimes left you with a recollection&mdash;a clue&mdash;that
helped you back more quickly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford hung on.
</p>

<p>
The surge took him, swept him, left him.  He was
with Brida in Brida's jolly little flat in Knightsbridge,
holding her hands.  It was a longish time since he had
been to see her.  She had come into the room gay as
ever&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford got suddenly back to the point whence
he had been suddenly cut adrift; remembered the surge,
realised the lapse, recalled how he had caught at her
hands, how they had soothed him, how, like a mock,
he had seen the laughter in her eyes.  Mr. Wriford
threw back her hands at her with a violent motion, and
went back a step, not meaning to, and knew again the
frequent desire in moments of stress such as had just
passed, and in moments of recovery such as he now was
in, to shout out very loudly a jumble of cries of despair,
as often he cried them at night, or inwardly when not
alone.  "O God!  Oh, I say!  I say!  I say!  Oh, this
can't go on!  Oh, this must end&mdash;this must end!  Oh,
I say!  I say!" but mastered the desire and effected
instead a confusion of sentences ending with "then."
</p>

<p>
A very great effort was required.  Mastery of such
impulses had been undermined these ten years, slipping
from him these five, altogether leaving him in recent
months.  To give way, and to release in clamorous cries
the tumult that consumed him, would ease him, he felt
sure; but it would create a scene and have him stared
at and laughed at, he knew.  That stopped him.  Fear of
the betrayal of his state, that day and night he dreaded,
once again saved him; and therefore in place of the
loud cries, Mr. Wriford&mdash;thirty, not bad-looking,
clever, successful, held to be "one of the lucky
ones"&mdash;substituted heavily: "Well then!  All right then!  It's
no good then!  Very well then!"
</p>

<p>
She was a trifle surprised by the violent action with
which he released her hands.  But she knew his moods
(not their depth) and had no comment to make on his
roughness.  "Oh, Phil," she cried, and her tone matched
her face in its mingling of gay banter and of tenderness,
"Oh, Phil, don't twist up your forehead so&mdash;frowning
like that.  Phil, don't!"  And when he made no
answer but with working face just stood there before her,
she went on: "You know that I hate to see you frowning
so horribly.  And I don't see why you should come
and do it in my flat; I'm blessed if I do!"
</p>

<p>
He did not respond to the gay little laugh with which
she poked her words at him.  He had come to her for
the rest, for the comfort, he had felt in that brief
moment when he first caught at her hands.  Instead, the
laughter in her eyes informed him that here, here also,
was not to be found what day and night he sought.
The interview must be ended, and he must get away.
He was in these days always fidgeting to end a
conversation, however eagerly he had begun it.
</p>

<p>
It must be ended&mdash;conventionally.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm busy," he said.  "I must be going."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Phil!" she exclaimed, and there was in her
voice just a trace of pleading.  "Now, Phil, don't be
in one of your moods!  It's not kind after all the ages
I've never seen you."  A settee was near her, and she
sat down and indicated the place beside her.  "Going!
Why, you've scarcely come!  Tell me what you've
been doing.  Months since you've been near me!  Of
course, I've heard about you.  I'm always hearing
your name or seeing it in the papers.  Clever little
beast, Phil!  I hear people talking about <i>The Week
Reviewed</i>, or about your books; and I say: 'Oh, I know
the editor well'; or 'He's a friend of mine&mdash;Philip
Wriford,' and I feel rather bucked when they exclaim
and want to know what you're like.  You must be
making pots of money, Phil, old boy."
</p>

<p>
He remained standing, making no motion to accept
the place beside her.  "I'm making what I should have
thought would be a good lot once," he said; and he
added: "You ought to have married me, Brida&mdash;when
you had the chance."
</p>

<p>
Just the faintest shadow flickered across her face.
But she replied with a little wriggle and a little laugh
indicative of a shuddering at her escape.  "It would
have been too awful," she said.  "You, with your
moods!  You're getting worse, Phil, you are really!"
</p>

<p>
He had seen the shadow.  Had it stayed, he had
crossed to her, caught her hands again, cried: "O Brida,
Brida!" and in that shadow's tenderness have found
the balm which in these days he craved for, craved for,
craved for.  He saw it pass and took instead the mock
of her light tone and words.  "Worse&mdash;yes, I know
I'm worse," he said violently.  "You don't know how
bad&mdash;nor any one."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, old boy."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing to tell."
</p>

<p>
"You're working too hard, Phil."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sick of hearing that.  That's all rubbish."
</p>

<p>
"Poor old boy!"
</p>

<p>
She saw his face work again; but "It's our press
night," was all he said.  "We go to press to-night.
I've the House of Commons' debate to read and an
article to write&mdash;two articles.  I must go, Brida."
</p>

<p>
She told him: "Well, you won't get the debate yet.
It's much too early.  Do sit down, Phil.  Here, by my
side, and talk, Phil, do!"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head and took up his hat; and she could
see how his hand that held it trembled.  He was at the
door with no more than "Good-bye" when she sprang to
her feet and called him back: "At least shake hands,
rude beast!" and when he gave his hand, she held it.
"What's up, old boy?"
</p>

<p>
He drew his hand away.  "Nothing, Brida."
</p>

<p>
"Just now&mdash;when you first came&mdash;what did you
mean by saying: 'All right then&mdash;it's no good
then.'  What did you mean by that, Phil?"
</p>

<p>
His face, while she waited his reply, was working as
though it mirrored clumsy working of his brain.  His
words, when he found speech, were blurred and
spasmodic, as though his brain that threw them up were a
machine gone askew and leaking under intense internal
stress, where it should have delivered in an amiable
flow.  "Why, I meant that it's no good," he said, "no
good looking for what I can't find.  I don't know what
it is, even.  Brida, I don't even know what it is that I
want.  Peace&mdash;rest&mdash;happiness&mdash;getting back to
what I used to be.  I don't know.  I can't explain.  I
can't even explain to myself&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, old boy?"
</p>

<p>
"I can do it at night.  Sometimes I can get near it
at night.  Sometimes I lie awake at night and call
myself all the vile, vile names I can think of.  Go through
the alphabet and find a name for what I am with every
letter.  But at the back of it&mdash;at the back of it there's
still&mdash;still a reservation, still an excuse for myself.
I want to tell some one.  I want to find some one to
tell it all to&mdash;to say 'I'm This and That and This and
That, and Oh! for God Almighty's sake help me&mdash;help
me&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
She knew his moods, and of their depth more at this
interview than ever before, and yet still in no wise
fathomed them.  He stopped, twisted in mind and in face
with his efforts, and she (his moods unplumbed) laughed,
thinking to rally him, and said: "Why, no, it's no good
calling yourself names to me, Phil."
</p>

<p>
He broke out more savagely than he had yet spoken,
and he had been violent enough:
</p>

<p>
"That's what I'm telling you.  No good&mdash;no good!
You'd laugh.  You're laughing now.  Everybody laughs.
I'm lucky!&mdash;so successful!&mdash;so happy!&mdash;no cares!&mdash;no
ties!&mdash;no troubles!  Other people have bad times!&mdash;others
are ill!&mdash;breakdowns and God knows what,
and responsibilities, and burdens, and misfortunes!
but me!&mdash;I've all the luck&mdash;I've everything!&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
When she could stop him, she said: "I don't laugh
at you, Phil.  That's not fair."
</p>

<p>
"You always do.  I thought I'd come to you to-day
to see.  I always come to you hoping.  But I always
go away knowing I'm a fool to have troubled.  Well,
I won't come again.  I always say that to myself.  Now
I've said it to you.  Now it's fixed.  I won't come back
again.  It's done&mdash;it's over!"
</p>

<p>
She put out her hand and touched his.  "Now, Phil!"
</p>

<p>
But he shook off her touch.  "You don't understand
me.  That's what it comes to."
</p>

<p>
"Phil!"
</p>

<p>
"No one does.  You least of all."
</p>

<p>
"Phil, you're ill, old boy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, laugh over that!" cried Mr. Wriford and
turned with a shuffling movement of his feet; and she
saw him blunder against the door-post as though he had
not noticed it; and stood listening white he went heavily
down the stairs; and heard him fumble with the latch
below and slam the outer door behind him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Now you shall picture this Mr. Wriford&mdash;thirty,
youthful of face, not bad-looking, clever, successful,
one of the lucky ones&mdash;walking back from Brida's
little flat in Knightsbridge to the office of <i>The Week
Reviewed</i> off Fleet Street, and as he walked, rehearsing
every passage of his own contribution to the interview
that had just passed, and as he rehearsed them, abusing
himself in every line of it.  It was not where he had been
rude or unkind to Brida that gave him distress.  There,
on the contrary, he found brief gleams of satisfaction.
There he had held his own.  It was where he had made
a fool of himself and exposed himself that gnawed him.
It was where she had laughed at him that he was stung.
He made an effort to distract his thoughts, to fix them
on the work to which he was proceeding, to attach them
anywhere ("Anywhere, anywhere, any infernal where!"
cried Mr. Wriford to himself).  Useless.  They rushed
back.  "From here to that pillar-box," cried Mr. Wriford
inwardly, "I'll fix on what I'm going to write in
my first leader."  He was not ten steps in the direction
when he was writhing again at having made a fool of
himself with Brida.  It was always so in these days.
"I never exchange words with a soul," cried Mr. Wriford,
"not even with a cab-driver&mdash;"  He was switched
off on the word to recollection of a fare-dispute with a
cab-driver on the previous day.  He was plunged back
into the humiliation he had suffered himself to endure
by not taking a strong line with the man.  It had
occupied him, gnawing, gnawing at him right up to this
afternoon with Brida, when new mortification, new
example of having been a weak fool, of having been
worsted in an encounter, had come to take its place.
</p>

<p>
So there was Mr. Wriford&mdash;one of the lucky ones&mdash;back
with this old gnawing again; and, realising the
swift transition from one to the other, able to complete
his broken sentence with a bitter laugh at himself for
the instance that had come to illustrate it.
</p>

<p>
"I never exchange a word with a soul, not even with
a cab-driver," cried Mr. Wriford, "but I show what a
weak fool I am, and then brood over it, brood over it,
until the next thing comes along to take its
place!"  Whereupon, and with which, another next thing came
immediately in further proof and in further assault
upon the thin film of Mr. Wriford's self-possession that
was in these days left to him.  In form, this came, of a
cyclist carrying a bundle of newspapers upon his back
and travelling at the hazard and speed and with the
dexterity that belong to his calling.  Mr. Wriford stepped
off the pavement to cross the road, stepped in front of
this gentleman, caused him to execute a prodigious
swerve to avoid collision, ejaculated very genuinely a
"Sorry&mdash;I'm awfully sorry," and was addressed in
raucous bawl of obscene abuse that added new terms to
the names which, as he had told Brida, he often lay
awake at night and called himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford gained the other side of the road badly
jarred as to his nerves but conscious only of this fresh
outrage to his sensibilities.  Was it that he looked a
fool that he was treated with such contempt?  Yes,
that was it!  Would that coarse brute have dared abuse
in that way a man who looked as if he could hold his
own?  No, not he!  Would a man who was a man and
not a soft, contemptible beast have cried "Sorry.  I'm
awfully sorry"?  No, no!  A man who was a man had
damned the fellow's eyes, shouted him down, threatened
him for his blundering carelessness.  He was hateful.
He was vile.  Now this&mdash;now this indignity, this new
exhibition of his weakness, was going to rankle, gnaw
him, gnaw him.  There surged over Mr. Wriford again,
standing on the kerb, the desire to wave his arms and
cry aloud, as he had desired to wave and cry with Brida
a few minutes before: "Oh!  I say!  I say!  I say!  This
can't go on!  This can't go on!  This has got to stop!
This has got to stop!"  Habit checked the impulse.
People were passing.  People were staring at him.  They
had seen the incident, perhaps.  They had witnessed
his humiliation and were laughing at him.  There was
wrung out of Mr. Wriford's lips a bitter cry, a groan,
that was articulate sound of his inward agony at
himself.  He turned in his own direction and began a swift
walk that was the slowest pace to which habit could
control the desire that consumed him to run, to run&mdash;by
running to escape his thoughts, by running to shake
off the inward mocking that mocked him as though
with mocking all the street resounded.  It appeared
indeed to Mr. Wriford, as often in these days it
appeared, that passers-by looked at him longer than
commonly one meets a casual glance, and had in their eyes
a grin as though they knew him for what he was and
needs must grin at the sight of it.  Mr. Wriford often
turned to look after such folk to see if they were turned
to laugh at him.  He had not now gone a dozen furious
paces, yet twice had wavered beneath glances directed
at him, when there greeted him cheerily with "Hullo,
Wriford!  How goes it?" a healthy-looking gentleman
who stopped before him and caused him to halt.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, desperate to be alone and to run, to
run, said: "Hullo, I'm late getting to the office.  I'm
in a tearing hurry," and stared at the man, aware of
another frequent symptom of these days: he could
not recollect his name!  He knew the man well.  Scarcely
a day passed but Mr. Wriford saw him.  This was the
literary editor of <i>The Intelligence</i>, the great daily
newspaper with which <i>The Week Reviewed</i> was connected
and in whose office it was housed.  A nice man, and of
congenial tastes; but a man whom at that moment
Mr. Wriford felt himself hating venomously, and while he
struggled, struggled for his name, experienced the
conscious wish that the man might fall down dead and so let
him be free, and so close those eyes of his that seemed to
Mr. Wriford to be looking right inside him and to be
grinning at what they saw.  And Mr. Wriford found
himself gone miles adrift among pictures of the scenes that
would occur if the man did suddenly drop dead; found
himself shaping the sentences that he would speak to
the policeman who would come up, shaping the words
with which, as he supposed would be his duty, he would
go and break the news to the man's wife, whom he knew
well, and whose shocked grief he found himself
picturing&mdash;but whose name!  Mr. Wriford came back to
the original horror, to the fact of standing before this
familiar&mdash;daily familiar&mdash;friend and having not the
remotest glimmering of what his name might be....
</p>

<p>
"I'm off to-morrow for a month's holiday," the man
was saying.  "A rest cure.  I've been needing it, my
doctor says.  You're looking fit, Wriford."
</p>

<p>
Habit helped Mr. Wriford to work up a smile.  Just
what he had been saying to Brida: "I'm so lucky!
Other people have bad times!&mdash;others are ill!&mdash;breakdowns
and God knows what!&mdash;but me!&mdash;I've all the
luck!"  Mr. Wriford worked up a smile.  "Oh, good
Lord, yes.  I'm always fit.  Sorry you're bad."  What
was his name?&mdash;his name! his name!
</p>

<p>
And the man went on: "You are so!&mdash;lucky beggar!
When's your new book coming out?  What, must you
cut?  Well, I'll see you again before I go.  I'm looking
in at the office to-night.  I've left you a revised proof of
that article of mine.  That was a good suggestion of
yours.  One of the bright ones, you!  So long!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford&mdash;one of the bright ones&mdash;shook hands
with him; and knew as he did so, and from the man's
slight surprise, that it was a stupid thing to do with a
man he met every day of his life; and leaving him,
became for some moments occupied with this new example
of his stupidity; and then back to the distress that he
could not, could not recollect his name; and furiously,
then, to the agony of the cyclist humiliation; and in all
the chaos of it got to a quiet street, and, hurrying at
frantic pace, frantically at last did cry aloud: "Oh, I
say!  I say!  I say!  I say!  This can't go on.  This has
got to stop!  This has got to stop!" and found himself
somehow arrived at the vast building of <i>The Intelligence</i>,
and at the sight by habit called upon himself and steadied
himself to enter.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Called upon himself....  Steadied himself....
He would encounter here men whom he knew....
He must not let them see....  Called upon himself
and passed up the stairs towards the landing that held
the offices of his paper.  There was a lift, but he did not
use it.  It would have entailed exchange of greeting
with the lift-boy, and in these days Mr. Wriford had
come to the pitch of shrinking from even the amount of
conversation which that would have entailed.  For
the same reason he paused a full three minutes on his
landing before turning along the corridor that approached
his office.  There were bantering voices which he
recognised for those of friends, and he waited till the group
dispersed and doors slammed.  He hated meeting people,
shrank from eyes that looked, not at him, but, as he
felt, into him, and, as he believed, had a grin in the tail
of them.
</p>

<p>
Doors slammed.  Silence in the corridor.  Mr. Wriford
went swiftly to his room.  The table was littered
with proofs and letters.  Mr. Wriford sat down heavily
in his chair and took up the office telephone.  There
was one thing to straighten up before he got to work,
and he spoke to the voice that answered him: "Do you
know if the literary editor is in his room?  The literary
editor&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Haig, sir," said the voice.  "No, sir, Mr. Haig
won't be back till late.  He left word that he'd put his
proof on your table, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Mr. Wriford.  "Get through to the
sub-editors' room and ask Mr. Hatchard if I may have
the Commons' debate report."
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Wriford put down the telephone and leaned
his head on his hands.  "Haig!  Of course that was his
name!  Oh, I say!  I say!  I say!"
</p>

CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
YOUNG WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Come back with Mr. Wriford a little.  Come back
with him a little to scenes where often his mind, not
wanders, but hunts&mdash;hunts desperately, as hunts for
safety, running in panic to and fro, one trapped by the
sea on whom the tide advances.  There are nights&mdash;not
occasional nights, but night after night, night after
night&mdash;when Mr. Wriford cannot sleep and when, in
madness against the sleep that will not come, he visions
sleep as some actual presence that is in his room mocking
him, and springs from his bed to grapple it and seize
it and drag it to his pillow.  There is a moment then&mdash;or
longer, he does not know how long&mdash;of dreadful loss
of identity, in which in the darkness Mr. Wriford
flounders and smashes about his room, thinking he wrestles
with sleep: and then he realises, and trembling gets
back to bed, and cries aloud to know how in God's
name to get out of this pass to which he has come, and
how in pity's name he has come to it.
</p>

<p>
Come back with him a little.  Look how his life as he
hunts through it falls into periods.  Look how these
bring him from Young Wriford that he was&mdash;Young
Wriford fresh, ardent, keen, happy, to whom across the
years he stretches trembling hands&mdash;to this Mr. Wriford,
one of the lucky ones, that he has become.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford of ten years before who has
just taken the tremendous plunge into what he calls
literature.  Here he is, just battling ardently with its
fearful hopes and hazards when there comes to him
news of Bill and Freda, his brother and sister-in-law,
killed by sudden accident in Canada where with their
children and Alice, Freda's elder sister, they had made
their home.  Here he is at the Liverpool docks, meeting
Alice and the three little boys to take them to her
mother's house in Surbiton.  He is the only surviving
near relative of Bill's family, and here he is, for old
Bill's sake, with every impulse concentrated on playing
the game by old Bill's poor little kids and by Alice
who, unhappy at home, has always lived with them
and been their "deputy-mother," and is now, as she
says, their own mother: here is Alice, with Harold
aged nine, Dicky aged eight, and Freddie aged seven;
Alice, who dreads coming to her home, who tells Young
Wriford in the train:
</p>

<p>
"I'm not crying for Freda and Bill.  I can't&mdash;I
simply can't realise that even yet.  It's not them,
Philip.  It's the future I'm thinking of.  Phil, what's
going to happen to my darlings?  They've got
nothing&mdash;nothing.  Father's got four hundred a year&mdash;less;
and I dread that.  I tell you I dread meeting mother
and father more than anything.  Mother means to be
kind&mdash;it's kind of her to take the children for Freda's
sake; but you know what she is and what father is.
And I've nothing&mdash;nothing!"
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford knows well enough what Mrs. Filmer
is.  Dragon Mrs. Filmer he has privately called her to
old Bill when writing of duty calls paid to the stuffy
little house at Surbiton, where the Dragon dragons it
over her establishment and over Mr. Filmer, who has
"retired" from business and who calls himself an
"inventor."  Young Wriford knows, and he has thought
it all out, and he has had an amazing piece of success
only a fortnight before, and he answers Alice bravely:
"Look here, old girl, I've simply colossal news for you.
You've not got to worry about all that a damn&mdash;sorry,
Alice, but not a damn, really.  You know I've chucked
the office and gone in for literature?  Well, what do you
think?  Whatever do you think?  I'm dashed if I haven't
got a place on the staff of Gamber's!  Gamber's, mind
you!  You know&mdash;<i>Gamber's Magazine</i> and <i>Gamber's
Weekly</i> and slats of other papers.  They'd been
accepting stuff of mine, and they wrote and asked me to call,
and&mdash;well, I'm on the staff!  I've got a roll-top desk
of my own and no end of an important position and&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;three guineas a week!  Well,
this is how it stands; I've figured it all out.  I can live
like a prince on twenty-five bob a week, and you're
going to have the other one pound eighteen.  No, it's
no good saying you won't.  You've got to.  Good Lord,
it's for old Bill I'm doing it.  Well, look at that now!
Nothing!  Why, you can tell Mrs. Filmer you've got
practically a hundred a year!  Ninety-eight pounds
sixteen.  That's not bad, is it? and twice as much before
long.  I tell you I'm going to make a fortune at this.
I simply love the work, you know.  No, don't call it
generous, old girl, or any rot like that.  It's not
generous.  I don't want the money.  I mean, I don't care
for anything except the work.  There, now you feel
better, don't you?  It's fixed.  I tell you it's fixed."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford with this fixed, and with it
working, as he believes, splendidly.  Here he is living
in a bed-sitting-room at Battersea, and revelling day
and night and always in the thrill of being what he
calls a literary man, and in the pride and glory of being
on the staff at Gamber's.  He loves the work.  He cares
for nothing else but the work.  That is why the shrewd
men at Gamber's spotted him and brought him in and
shoved him into Gamber's machine; and that is why he
never breaks or crumples but springs and comes again
when the hammers, the furnaces, and the grindstones
of Gamber's machine work him and rattle him and
mould him.
</p>

<p>
A Mr. Occshott controls Gamber's machine.  Mr. Occshott
in appearance and in tastes is much more like
a cricket professional than Young Wriford's early ideas
of an editor.  Literary young men on Gamber's staff
call Mr. Occshott a soulless ox and rave aloud against
him, and being found worthless by him, are flung
raving out of Gamber's machine, which he relentlessly
drives.  In Young Wriford, Mr. Occshott tells himself
that he has found a real red-hot 'un, and for the ultimate
benefit of Gamber's he puts the red-hot 'un through
the machine at all its fiercest; sighs and groans at Young
Wriford, and checks him here and checks him there,
and badgers him and drives him all the time&mdash;slashes
his manuscripts to pieces; comes down with contemptuous
blue pencil and a cutting sneer whenever in them
Young Wriford gets away from facts and tries a
flight of fancy; hunts for missed errors through proofs
that Young Wriford has read, and finds them and sends
for Young Wriford, and asks if it is his eyesight or his
education that is at fault, and if it is of the faintest use
to hope that he can ever be trusted to pass a proof for
himself; puts Young Wriford on to "making-up" pages
of Gamber's illustrated periodicals for press, and pulls
them all to pieces after they are done, and sends Young
Wriford himself to face the infuriated printer and to
suffer dismay and mortification in all his soul as he hears
the printer say: "Well, that's the limit!  Take my oath,
that's the limit!  'Bout time, Mr. Wriford, you give my
compliments to Mr. Occshott and tell him I wish to
God Almighty he'd put any gentleman on to make up
the pages except you.  It's waste labour&mdash;it's sheer
waste labour&mdash;doing anything you tell us.  Take my
oath it is."
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford assures himself that he hates Mr. Occshott,
but steadily learns, steadily benefits; finds
that he really likes Mr. Occshott and is liked by him;
steadily, ardently sticks to it&mdash;earns his reward.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there it is," says Mr. Occshott one day,
throwing aside the manuscript over which Young Wriford
had taken infinite pains only to have it horribly
mangled.  "There it is.  Have another shot at it, Wriford.
And, by the way, you're not doing badly&mdash;not badly.
You're awfully careless, you know, but I think you're
picking it up.  We're starting a new magazine, a kind
of popular monthly review, and I'm going to put you in
nominal charge of it&mdash;charge of the make-up and
seeing to press and all that.  And your salary&mdash;you've
been here six months, haven't you?  Three guineas,
you're getting?  Well, it'll be four now.  Make a real
effort with this new idea, Wriford.  I'll tell you more
about it to-morrow.  A real effort&mdash;you really must,
you know.  Well, there it is."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford not quite so youthful as a few
months before.  He has lost his keen interest in games
and recreation.  He thinks nothing but work, breathes
nothing but work; most significant symptom of all,
sometimes dreams work or lies awake at night a little
because his mind is occupied with work.  That in itself,
though, is nothing: he likes it, he relishes every
moment of it.  What accounts more directly for the slight
loss of youthfulness, what increasingly interferes with
his relish of his work, is what comes up from the Filmer
household at Surbiton in form of frequent letters from
Alice; is what greets him there when he fulfils Alice's
entreaties by giving up his every week-end to spending
it as Dragon Mrs. Filmer's guest.
</p>

<p>
The letters begin to worry him, to get on his nerves,
to give him for some reason that he cannot quite
determine a harassing feeling of self-reproach.  They are
inordinately long; they consist from beginning to end
of a recital of passages-at-arms between Alice and her
parents; they seem to hint, when in replies to them he
tries to reason away the troubles, that it is all very well
for Young Wriford, who is out of it all and free and
comfortable and happy, but that if he were here&mdash;!
</p>

<p>
"Well, but what more can I do than I am doing?"
Young Wriford cries aloud to himself on receipt of such
a letter; and thenceforward that question and alternate
fits of impatience and of self-reproach over it, and letters
expressive first of one frame of mind and then, in
remorse, of the other&mdash;thenceforward these occupy more
and more of his thoughts, and more and more mix with
his work and disturb his peace of mind.  Why is all this
put upon him?  Why can't he be left alone?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford in love.  She is eighteen.  Her
name is Brida.  She is working for the stage at a school
of dramatic art quite close to Gamber's.  He gets to
know her through a friend at Gamber's whose sister is
also at the school.  Young Wriford and Brida happen to
lunch every day&mdash;meeting without arrangement&mdash;at
the same tea-shop off the Strand.  She leaves her school
at the same hour he leaves Gamber's in the evening,
and they happen to meet every evening&mdash;without
arrangement&mdash;and he walks home with her across
St. James's Park to a Belgravia flat where she lives with
her married sister.  Young Wriford thinks of her face,
day and night, as like a flower&mdash;radiant and fresh and
fragrant as a flower at dawn; and of her spirit as a
flower&mdash;gay as a posy, fragrant as apple-blossom, fresh as a
rose, a rose!
</p>

<p>
And so one Friday evening as they cross the Park
together, when suddenly she challenges his unusual
silence with: "I say, you're jolly glum to-night,"
he replies with a plump: "I'm going to call you
Brida."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, goodness!" says Brida and begins to walk very
fast.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mind?"
</p>

<p>
She shakes her head.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let's hurry.  Stop here a moment."
</p>

<p>
It is dusk.  It is October.  There is no one near them.
He begins to speak.  His eyes tell her what he can
scarcely say: her eyes and that which tides in deepest
colour across her face inform him what her answer is.
He takes her in his arms.  He tells her: "I love
you, darling.  Brida, I love you."  She whispers:
"Phil!"
</p>

<p>
He goes home exalted in his every pulse by what he
has drunk from her lips: plumed, armed, caparisoned by
that ethereal draught for any marvels, challenging the
future to bring out its costliest, mightiest, bravest,
best&mdash;he'd have it, he'd wrest it for his sweet, his darling!
He goes home&mdash;and there is Alice waiting for him.
Can't he, oh, can't he come down to Surbiton to-night,
Friday, instead of waiting till to-morrow?  She simply
cannot bear it down there without him.  It's all right
when he is there.  When she's alone with her mother,
her mother goes on and on and on about the expenses,
and about the children, and seems to throw the blame
on Bill, and she answers back, and her father joins in,
and there they are&mdash;at it!  There's been a worse
scene than ever to-day.  She can't face meeting them
at supper without Phil.  "Phil, you'll come, won't
you?"
</p>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford twisting his hands and twisting
his brows, as often in later years he comes to twist them.
He had planned to spend all to-morrow and Sunday with
Brida&mdash;not go to Surbiton at all this week-end.  Now
he must go to-night.  Why?  Why on earth should this
kind of thing be put on him?  He tries to explain to
Alice that he cannot come&mdash;either to-day or to-morrow.
She cries.  He lets her cry and lets her go&mdash;doing his
best to make her think him not wilfully unkind.  Here
he is left alone in torment of self-reproach and of anger
at the position he is placed in.  Here he is with the
self-reproach mastering him, and writing excuses to Brida,
and hurrying to catch a train that will get him down to
Surbiton in time for supper.  Here is Dragon Mrs. Filmer
greeting him with: "Well, this is unexpected!
You couldn't of course have sent a line saying you were
coming to-night instead of to-morrow!  Oh, no, I mustn't
expect that!  My convenience goes for nothing in my
own house nowadays.  I call it rather hard on me."  Here
is Mr. Filmer, with his face exactly like a sheep,
who replies at supper when Young Wriford lets out that
he has been to a theatre-gallery during the week: "Well,
I must say some people are very lucky to be able to
afford such things.  I'm afraid they don't come our
way.  We have a good many mouths to feed in this
household, haven't we, Alice, h'm, ha?"
</p>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford in bed, pitying himself,
reproaching himself, thinking of Brida, thinking of the
Filmers, thinking of old Bill, thinking of Alice, thinking
of his work ... pitying himself; hating himself for
doing it; in a tangle; in a torment....
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
Here is Young Wriford beginning to chafe at Gamber's.
Here he is beginning to find himself&mdash;wanting
to do better work than the heavy hand of Mr. Occshott
will admit to the popular pages of Gamber periodicals;
and beginning to lose himself&mdash;feeling the effect of
many different strains; growing what Brida calls
"nervy"; slowly changing from ardent Young Wriford
to "nervy" Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
The different strains all clash.  There is no rest
between them nor relief in any one of them.  They all
involve "scenes"&mdash;scenes with Brida, who has left the
dramatic school and is on the London stage, who thinks
that if Young Wriford really cared tuppence about her
he would give up an occasional Sunday to her&mdash;but
no, he spends them all at Surbiton and when he does
come near her is "nervy" and seems to expect her to be
sentimental and sorry for him; scenes with the Filmers
and even with Alice because now when he comes down
to them he doesn't, as they tell him, "seem to think of
their dull lives" but wants to shut himself up and work
at the novel or whatever it is that he is writing; scenes
with Mr. Occshott when he brings Mr. Occshott the
"better work" that he tries to do during the week-ends
and at night and is told that he is wasting his time doing
that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
Is he wasting his time?  Yes, he is wasting it at
Gamber's, he tells himself.  He can do better work.  He
wants to do better work.  No scope for it at Gamber's,
and one day he has it out with Mr. Occshott.
Mr. Occshott hands back to him, kindly but rather vexedly,
a series of short stories which is of the "better work"
he feels he can do.  Young Wriford sends the stories to
a rival magazine of considerably higher standard than
Gamber's, purposely putting upon them what seems to
him an outrageous price.  They are accepted.
</p>

<p>
That settles it.  Young Wriford goes to Mr. Occshott.
"I'm sorry, sir&mdash;awfully sorry.  I've been very happy
here.  You've been awfully good to me.  But I want to
do bet&mdash;other work.  I'm going to resign."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Occshott is extraordinarily kind.  Young Wriford
finds himself quite affected by all that Mr. Occshott
says.  Mr. Occshott is not going to let Gamber's lose
Young Wriford at any price.  "Is it money?" he asks
at last.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's money&mdash;partly," Young Wriford tells
him.  "But I don't want you to think I'm trying to
bounce a rise out of you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, of course I don't think so," says
Mr. Occshott.  "You're getting five pounds a week.  What's
your idea?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I ought to be making four hundred a year,"
says Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," says Mr. Occshott and laughs.  "All
right.  You are.  Is that all right?"
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford is overwhelmed.  He had never
expected this.  He hesitates.  He almost agrees.  But it
is only, as he had said, "partly" a question of money.
It is the better work that really he wants.  It is the
constant chafing against the Gamber limitations that
really actuates him.  He knows what it will be if he
stays on.  He is quite confident of himself if he resists
this temptation and leaves.  He says: "No.  It's
awfully good of you&mdash;awfully good.  But it's not only
the question of money"; and then he fires at
Mr. Occshott a bombshell which blows Mr. Occshott to
blazes.
</p>

<p>
"I'm writing a novel," says Young Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!" says Mr. Occshott and covers his
face with his hands.
</p>

<p>
There is no room in any well-regulated popular periodical
office for a young man who is writing a novel.
It is over.  It is done.  Good-bye to Gamber's!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
VII
</h4>

<p>
And immediately the catastrophe, the crash; the
springing upon Young Wriford of that which finally and
definitely is to catch him and hunt him and drive him
from the Young Wriford that he is to the Mr. Wriford
that he is to be; the scene that follows when he tells
Alice and the Filmers what he has done.
</p>

<p>
He tells them enthusiastically.  In this moment of his
first release from Gamber's to pursue the better work
that he has planned, he forgets the depression that
always settles upon him in the Surbiton establishment,
and speaks out of the ardour and zest of successes soon
to be won that, apart from the joy of telling it all to
some one, makes him more than ever grudge this weekend
visit when work is impossible.  He finishes and then
for the first time notices the look upon the faces of his
listeners.  He finishes, and there is silence, and he stares
from one to the other and has sudden foreboding at
what he sees but no foreboding of that which comes to
pass.
</p>

<p>
Alice is first to speak.  "Oh, Phil," says
Alice&mdash;trembling voice and trembling lips.  "Oh, Phil!  Left
Gamber's!"
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Filmer.  "Well, really!" says Mr. Filmer.
"Well, really&mdash;h'm, ha!"
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Filmer.  "This I did not expect.  This I
refuse to believe.  Left Gamber's!  I cannot believe
anything so hard on me as that.  I cannot."
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford manages to say: "Well, why not?"
and at once there is released upon him by Mr. and
Mrs. Filmer the torrent that seems to him to last for hours
and hours.
</p>

<p>
Why not!  Is he aware that they were awaiting his
arrival this very week-end to tell him what it had
become useless to suppose he would ever see for himself?
Why not!  Does he realise that the expenses of feeding
and clothing and above all of educating Bill's children
are increasing beyond endurance month by month as
they grow up?  Why not!  Has he ever taken the
trouble to look at the boys' clothes, at their boots, and
to realise how his brother's children have to be dressed
in rags while he lives in luxury in London?  Has he ever
taken the trouble to do that?  Perhaps his lordship who
can afford to throw up a good position will condescend
to do so now; and Mrs. Filmer takes breath from her
raving and rushes to the door and bawls up the stairs:
"Harold!  Fred!  Dicky!  Come and show your clothes
to your kind uncle!  Come and hear what your kind
uncle has done!  Harold!  Freddie&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford, seated at the table, his head in his
hands: "Oh, don't!  Oh, for God's sake, don't!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't!" cries Mrs. Filmer.  "No, don't let you be
troubled by it!  It's what our poor devoted Alice has
to see day after day.  It's what Mr. Filmer and I have
to screw ourselves to death to try to prevent."
</p>

<p>
"And their schooling," says Mr. Filmer.  "And their
schooling, h'm, ha."
</p>

<p>
Schooling!  This settles their schooling, Mrs. Filmer
cries.  They'll have to leave their day-schools now.  He'll
have the pleasure of seeing his brother's children
attending the board-school.  Three miserable guineas a
week he's been contributing to the expenses, and was
to be told to-day it was insufficient, and here he
is with the news that he has left Gamber's!  Here
he is&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Good God!" cries Young Wriford.  "Good God,
why didn't you tell me all this before?" and then, as at
this the storm breaks upon him again, gets to his feet
and cries distractedly: "Stop it!  Stop it!" and then
breaks down and says: "I'm sorry&mdash;I'm sorry.  I
didn't mean that.  It's come all of a blow at me, all this.
I never knew.  I never dreamt it.  It'll be all right.  If
you'll let me alone, I swear it'll be all right.  The three
guineas won't stop.  I've arranged to do two weekly
articles for Gamber's for three guineas on purpose to
keep Alice going.  I can get other work.  There's other
work I've heard of&mdash;only I wanted to do better&mdash;of
course that doesn't matter now.  Look here, if the worst
comes to the worst, I'll go back to Gamber's.  They'll
take me back if I promise to give up the work I want
to do.  I'm sorry.  I never realised.  I never thought
about all that.  I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
He is sorry.  That, both now and for the years that
are to come, is his chief thought&mdash;his daily, desperate
anxiety: sorry to think how he has let his selfish ideas
of better work, his thoughts of marrying Brida, blind
him to his duty to devoted Alice and to old Bill's kids.
Think of her life here!  Think of those poor little
beggars growing up and the education they ought to have,
the careers old Bill would have wished them to enter!
He is so sorry that only for one sharp moment does he
cry out in utter dread at the proposal which now
Mrs. Filmer, a little mollified, fixes upon him.
</p>

<p>
"In any case," says Mrs. Filmer, "whatever you
manage to do or decide to do, you'd better come and
live here.  You can live far more cheaply here than
letting a London landlady have part of your income."
</p>

<p>
Only for one sharp moment he protests.  "I couldn't!"
Young Wriford cries.  "I couldn't work here.  I simply
couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"You can have a nice table put in your bedroom,"
says Mrs. Filmer.  "If you're really sorry, if you really
intend to do your duty by your brother's children&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"All right," says Young Wriford.  "It's very kind
of you.  All right."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
He does not return to Gamber's.  He is one of the
lucky ones.  The great daily newspaper, the <i>Intelligence</i>,
has a particular fame for its column of leaderettes
and latterly is forever throwing out those who
write them in search of one who shall restore them to
their old reputation (recently a little clouded).  Young
Wriford puts in for the post and gets it and holds it and
soon couples with it much work on the literary side of
the paper.  There is a change in the proprietorship of
the penny evening paper, the <i>Piccadilly Gazette</i>,
bringing in one who turns the paper upside down to fill it
with new features.  Young Wriford puts in specimens
of a column of facetious humour&mdash;"Hit or
Miss"&mdash;and it is established forthwith, and every
morning he is early at the <i>Piccadilly Gazette</i> office to
produce it.
</p>

<p>
Thus within a very few weeks of leaving Gamber's
and of coming to live at Surbiton, he is earning more
than twice as much as he had relinquished&mdash;proving
himself most manifestly one of the lucky ones, and
earning the money and the reputation at cost to himself
of which only himself is aware.
</p>

<p>
He is from the house at seven each morning to reach
the <i>Piccadilly Gazette</i> by eight, hunting through the
newspapers as the train takes him up for paragraphs
wherewith to be funny in "Hit or Miss."  There are
days, and gradually they become more frequent, when
nothing funny will come to his mind; when his mind is
hopelessly tired; when his column is flogged out amid
furious protests, and expostulations informing him that
he is keeping the whole damned paper waiting; when
he leaves the office badly shaken, cursing it, hating it,
dreading that this day's work will earn him dismissal
from it, and hurries back to the "nice table" in his
bedroom at Surbiton, there desperately to attack the
two weekly articles for Gamber's, the book-reviewing
for the <i>Intelligence</i> and the work upon his novel: that
"better work," opportunity for which had caused him to
leave Mr. Occshott and now is immeasurably harder
to find.
</p>

<p>
He gets into the habit of trying to enter the house
noiselessly and noiselessly to get to his room.  He comes
back to the house trying to forget his misgiving about
his "Hit or Miss" column and to force his mind to
concentrate on the work he now has to do: above all,
trying to avoid meeting any one in the house, which
means, if he succeeds, avoiding "a scene" caused by
his overwrought nerves.  He never does succeed.  There
is always a scene.  It is either irritation with Alice or
with one of the boys who delay him or interrupt him,
and then regret and remorse at having shown his
temper; or it is a scene of wilder nature with Dragon
Mrs. Filmer or with Mr. Filmer.  Whatever the scene, the
result is the same&mdash;inability for an hour, for two hours,
for all the morning, properly to concentrate upon his
work.
</p>

<p>
It will be perhaps the matter of his room.  The
servant is making the bed, or it isn't made, and he knows
he will be interrupted directly he starts.
</p>

<p>
Pounce comes Dragon Mrs. Filmer.
</p>

<p>
"Well, goodness knows I leave the house early
enough," says Young Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Goodness knows you do," says Mrs. Filmer.
"Breakfast at half-past six!"
</p>

<p>
"I never get it."
</p>

<p>
"You're never down for it."
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford, face all twisted: "Oh, what's the
good!  We're not talking about that.  It's about my
room."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Filmer, lips compressed: "Certainly it's about
your room, and perhaps you'll tell me how the servants&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford: "All I'm saying is that I don't see
why my room shouldn't be done first."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Filmer (attracted to the battle): "I'm sure if
as much were done for me as is done for you in this
establishment&mdash;h'm, ha."
</p>

<p>
Alice (come to the rescue): "You know, Philip, you
said you thought you wouldn't get back till lunch this
morning."
</p>

<p>
Young Wriford, staring at them all, feeling incoherent,
furious ravings working within him, with a despairing
gesture: "Oh, all right, all right, <i>all right</i>!  I'm sorry.
Don't go on about it.  Just let me alone.  I'm all
behindhand.  I'm&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
In this mood he begins his work.  This is the mood
that has to be fought down before any of the work can
be successfully done.  Often a day will reward him
virtually nothing.  He is always behindhand, always trying
to catch up.  At six he rushes from the house to get to
the <i>Intelligence</i> office.  He is rarely back again to bed
by one o'clock: from the house again at seven.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IX
</h4>

<p>
Now the thing has Young Wriford and rushes him:
now grips him and drives him, now marks him and
drops him as he takes it.  Now the years run.  Now to
the last drop the Young Wriford is squeezed out of
him: Mr. Wriford now.  Now men name him for one
of the lucky ones.  Now, as he lies awake at night, and
as he trembles as he walks by day, he hates himself and
pities himself and dreads himself.
</p>

<p>
Now the years run&mdash;flash by Mr. Wriford&mdash;bringing
him much and losing him all; flash and are gone.  Now
he might leave the Filmer household and live again by
himself.  But there is no leaving it, once he is of it.
Alice wants him, and he tells himself it is his duty to stay
by her.  His money is wanted, and there never leaves
him the dread of suddenly losing his work and bringing
them all to poverty.  Now he gives up other work and is
of the <i>Intelligence</i> alone, handsomely paid, one of the
lucky ones.  It gives him no satisfaction.  It would have
thrilled Young Wriford, but Young Wriford is dead.
Now there is no pinching in the Surbiton establishment,
decided comfort rather.  The boys are put to good
schools and shaped for good careers.  The establishment
itself is moved to larger and pleasanter accommodation.
Alice is grateful, the boys are happy, even the
Filmers are grateful.  That Young Wriford who sat in
the train with Alice coming down from Liverpool eight
years before and planned so enthusiastically and schemed
so generously would have been happy, proud, delighted
to have done it all.  But that Young Wriford is
dead.  Mr. Wriford spends nothing on himself because
he wants nothing&mdash;interests, tastes other than work,
are coffined in Young Wriford's grave.  Mr. Wriford
just produces the money and begs&mdash;nervily as ever,
nay, more nervily than before&mdash;to be let alone to
work; he is always behindhand.
</p>

<p>
Now the novel is at last written and is published and
flames into success.  Imagine Young Wriford's amazed
delight!  But Young Wriford is dead.  Mr. Wriford,
one of the lucky ones, lucky in this as in all the rest,
contracts handsomely for others and at once is in the
rush of fulfilling a contract; that is all.
</p>

<p>
Now Alice is taken sick&mdash;mortally sick.  Lingers a
long while, wants Mr. Wriford badly to sit with her and
wants him always, is only upset by her mother.  Young
Wriford would have nursed her and wept for her.
Mr. Wriford nurses her very devotedly, as she says, but in
long hours grudged from his work, as he knows.  And
has no tears.  What, are even tears buried with Young
Wriford?  Mr. Wriford believes they are and hates
himself anew and thousandfold that he has no
sympathy, and often in remorse rushes home from the
nightly fight with the <i>Intelligence</i> to go to Alice's
bedside and make amends&mdash;not for active neglects, for
there have been none&mdash;but for the secret dryness of his
heart while he is with her and his thoughts are with
his work.  These are stirrings of Young Wriford, but of
what avail stirrings within the tomb?
</p>

<p>
Alice dies.  Here is Mr. Wriford by her death caught
anew and caught worse in the meshes that entangle
him.  Remorse oppresses him at every thought of
neglect of her and unkindness to her through these
years.  It can only be assuaged by new devotion to her
boys and to her parents, much changed and stricken by
her loss.  He might leave this household now.  He feels
it is his duty to remain in it.  They want him.
</p>

<p>
The thing goes on&mdash;swifter, fiercer, dizzier, and more
dizzily yet.  No one notices it.  He's young, that's all
they notice, not yet thirty, very youthful in the face,
one of the lucky ones: that's all they notice.  It goes
on.  He hides it, has to hide it.  Can't bear that any of
its baser manifestations&mdash;nerves, nervousness,
shrinking&mdash;should be noticed.  This is the stage of shunning
people&mdash;of avoiding people's eyes that look, not at
him, but into him and laugh at him.  It goes on.  He
surprises himself by the work he does&mdash;always believes
that this which has brought him merit, that which has
named him one of the lucky ones anew, never can be
equalled again; yet somehow is equalled; yet ever, as
looking back he believes, at cost of greater effort, with
touch less sure.  This is the stage of beginning to
expect that one day there will be an end, an explosion,
all the fabric of his life and his success cant on its rotten
foundations and come crashing.
</p>

<p>
Now the years run.  The <i>Intelligence</i> people conceive
<i>The Week Reviewed</i>: Mr. Wriford forms it, executes it,
launches it, carries it to success, and the more energy he
devotes to it the less has to resist the crumbling of his
foundations.  One of the lucky ones&mdash;one that has
reached the stage of conscious effort to perform a task,
drives himself through it, finishes it trembling, and only
wants to get away from everybody to hide how he
trembles, and only wants to get to bed where it is dark
and quiet, and only lies there turning from tangle to
tangle of his preoccupations, counting the hours that
refuse him sleep, crying to himself as he has been heard
to cry: "Oh, I say, I say, I say!  This can't go on!
This must end!  This must end!"
</p>

<p>
Thus, thus with Mr. Wriford, and worse and worse,
and worse and worse.  Thus through the years and
thus arrived where first we found him.  Behold him
now, ten years from when Young Wriford, just twenty,
met Alice and the children at Liverpool and ardently
and eagerly and fearlessly planned his tremendous
plans.  That boy is dead.  Return to him, little over
thirty, everywhere successful, one of the lucky ones,
that is come out of the grave where Young Wriford
lies.  Worse and worse!  There is nothing he touches
but brings him success; there is no one he meets or
who speaks of him but envies him; and successful,
lucky, it is only by throwing himself desperately into
his work that he can forget the intolerable misery that
presses upon him, the desire to wave his arms and
scream aloud: "You call me lucky!  Oh, my God!  Oh,
can't anybody see I'm going out of my mind with all
this?  Oh, isn't there anybody who can understand me
and help me?  Oh, I say, I say, I say, this can't go on.
This must stop.  This must end."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
X
</h4>

<p>
You see, he can't get out of it.  In these years his
unceasing work, his harassing work, his fears of it
breaking down and bringing all who are dependent upon
him to misery, and all his distresses of mind between
the one and the other&mdash;all this has killed outlets by
which now he might escape from it and has chained him
hand and foot and heart and mind in the midst of it.
His nephews leave him one by one to go out into the
world, successfully equipped and started by his efforts.
He is always promising himself, as first Harold goes,
and then Fred and then Dick, who has chosen for the
Army and enters Sandhurst, that now he will be able to
change his mode of life and seek the rest and peace he
craves for.  He never does.  He never can.
</p>

<p>
He never can.  There is always a point in his work
on his paper or with his books first to be reached: and
when it is reached, there is always another.  Now,
surely, with Dick soon going out to India, he might
leave the Filmers.  They are comfortably circumstanced
on their own means; the house is his and costs
them nothing.  Surely now, he tells himself, he might
break away and leave them: but he cries to himself
that for this reason and for that he cannot&mdash;yet: and
he cries to himself that if he could, he knows not how he
could.  Everything in life that might have attracted
him is buried ten years' deep in Young Wriford's grave.
Brida could rescue him, he believes, and he tries Brida
on that afternoon which has been seen: ah, like all the
rest, she laughs at him&mdash;one of the lucky ones!
</p>

<p>
He is chained to himself, to that poor, shrinking,
hideous devil of a Mr. Wriford that he has been made:
and this is the period of furious hatred of that self, of
burying himself in his work to avoid it, of sitting and
staring before him and imagining he sees it, of threatening
it aloud with cries of: "Curse you!  Curse you!" of
scheming to lay violent hands upon it.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
FIGURE OF WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
There comes that day when Mr. Wriford went to
Brida in desperate search of some one who should
understand him and give him peace.  It is a week after Dick
has been shipped to join his regiment in India, and after
a week alone with the Filmers, and of knowing not, even
now that his responsibilities are finally ended, how to
get out of it all&mdash;yet.  It was his press-night with <i>The
Week Reviewed</i>, as he had told Brida, and Mr. Wriford,
with two articles to write, called upon himself for the
effort to write them and to get his paper away by
midnight&mdash;the weekly effort to "pull through"&mdash;and
somehow made it.
</p>

<p>
Press-nights nowadays were one long, desperate grip
upon himself to keep himself going until, far distant in
the night and through a hundred stresses of his brain,
the goal of "pulled through" should be reached.  A
hundred stresses!  He always told himself, as the
contingencies of the night heaped before him, that this
time he would shirk this one, delegate that one to a
subordinate.  He never did.  Fleet Street said of <i>The Week
Reviewed</i>&mdash;a new thing in journalism&mdash;that Mr. Wriford
was "IT."  Unique among politico-literary
weeklies in that it went to press in one piece in one day,
and thus from first page to last presented a balance of
contents based upon the affairs of the immediate
moment, unique in that it was illustrated, in that it had
at its command all the resources of the <i>Intelligence</i>, in
that its price was two-pence&mdash;unique in all this, it was
said by those who knew that <i>The Week Reviewed's</i> very
great success was more directly due to the fact that it
was saturated and polished in every article, every
headline, every caption, by Mr. Wriford's touch.  He would
never admit how much of it he actually wrote himself;
it only was known to all who had a hand in the making
of it that nothing of which they had knowledge went
into the paper precisely in the form in which it first came
beneath Mr. Wriford's consideration.  Sometimes, in
the case of articles written by outside contributors of
standing, members of his staff would remonstrate with
him in some apprehension at this mangling of a
well-known writer's work.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what does it matter whom he is?" Mr. Wriford
would cry.  "I don't mind people thinking things in
the paper are rotten, if I've passed them and thought
them good.  But I'm damned if I let things go in that
I know are rotten, just because they're written by some
big man.  I don't mind my own judgment being blamed.
But I'm not going to hear criticism of anything in my
paper and know that I made the same criticism myself
but let it go.  Satisfy yourself!  That's the only rule to
go by."
</p>

<p>
Therefore on this press-night as on every press-night&mdash;but
somehow with worse effect this night than any&mdash;behold
Mr. Wriford <i>satisfying himself</i>, and in the process
whirling along towards the state that finds him sick
and dizzy and trembling when at last the paper has
gone to press and once more he has pulled through.
Behold him shrinking lower in his chair as the night
proceeds, smoking cigarettes in the way of six or seven
puffs at each, then giddiness, and then hurling it from
him with an exclamation, and then the craving for
another if another line is to be written, and then the same
process again; stopping in his work in the midst of a
sentence, in the midst of a word, to examine a page sent
down from the composing-room; twisting himself over
it to <i>satisfy himself</i> with it; rushing up-stairs with it to
where, amid heat and atmosphere that are vile and
intolerable to him, the linotype machines are rattling with
din that is maddening to him, to <i>satisfy himself</i> that the
page has not been rushed to the foundry without his
emendations; there, a hundred times, sharp argument
that is infuriating to him with head-printer and
machine-manager who battle with time and are always behind
time because advertisements and blocks are late, and
now, as they say, he must needs come and pull a page to
pieces; down to his room again, and more and worse
interruptions that a thousand times he tells himself he
is a fool not to leave in other hands and yet will attend
to to <i>satisfy himself</i>; time wasted with superior members
of his staff who come to write the final leaders on the last
of the night's news and who are affected by no thought of
need for haste but must wait and gossip till this comes
from Reuter's or that from <i>The Intelligence's</i> own
correspondent; time wasted over the line they think should
be taken and the line to which Mr. Wriford, to <i>satisfy
himself</i>, must induce them.  Sometimes, thus occupied
with one of these men, Mr. Wriford&mdash;a part of his
mind striving to concentrate on the article he was
himself in the midst of writing, part concentrating on
the page that lay before him waiting to be examined,
part on the jump in expectation of a frantic printer's
boy rushing in for the page at any moment, and the
whole striving to force itself from these distractions and
fix on the subject under discussion&mdash;sometimes in these
tumults Mr. Wriford would have the impulse to let the
man go and write what he would and be damned to him,
or the page go as it stood and be damned to it, or his
own article be cancelled and something&mdash;anything to
fill&mdash;take its place.  But that would not be <i>satisfying
himself</i>, and that would be present relief at the cost of
future dissatisfaction, and somehow Mr. Wriford would
make the necessary separate efforts&mdash;somehow pull
through.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Somehow pull through!  In the midst of the worst
nights, Mr. Wriford would strive to steady himself by
looking at the clock and assuring himself that in three
hours&mdash;two hours&mdash;one hour&mdash;by some miracle the
tangle would straighten itself, and he would have pulled
through and the paper be gone to press, as he had pulled
through and the paper been got away before.  So it
would be to-night&mdash;but to-night!  "If I dropped dead,"
said Mr. Wriford to himself, standing in his room on
return from a rush up-stairs to the composing-room,
and striving to remember in which of his tasks he had
been interrupted, "if I dropped dead here where I am
and left it all unfinished, we should get to press just the
same somehow.  Well, let me, for God's sake, fix on
that and go leisurely and steadily as if it didn't matter.
I shall go mad else; I shall go mad."  But in a moment
he was caught up in the storm again and <i>satisfying
himself</i>&mdash;and somehow pulling through.  At shortly before
midnight he was rushing up-stairs with the last page
of his own article, and remaining then in the composing-room
that sickened him and dazed him, himself to make
up the last two forms&mdash;correcting proofs on wet paper
that would not show the corrections and maddened
him; turning aside to cut down articles to fit columns;
turning aside to scribble new titles or to shout them to
the compositors who stood waiting to set them; turning
aside to use tact with the publisher's assistant who was
up in distraction to know what time they were ever
likely to get the machines going; turning aside to send
a messenger to ask if that last block was ever coming;
calculating all the time against the clock to the last
fraction of a second how much longer he could delay&mdash;forever
turning aside, forever calculating; deciding at
last that the late block must not be waited for; peering
in the galley racks to decide what should fill the space
that had been left for it; selecting an article and cutting
it to fit; at highest effort of concentration scanning the
pages that at last were in proof&mdash;then to the printer:
"All right; let her go!"  Pulled through!  And the
heavy mallets flattening down the type no more than
echoes of the smashing pulses in his brain....
</p>

<p>
Pulled through! dizzily down-stairs.  Pulled through! and
too sick, too spent, too nerveless, to exchange
words with those of his staff who had been up-stairs
with him and were come down, thanking heaven it was
over.  Pulled through! and too spent, too finished, to
clear up the litter of his room as he had intended&mdash;capable
only of dropping into his chair and then, realising
his state, of calling upon himself in actual whispers:
"Wriford!  Wriford!  Wriford!" but no responding energy.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
He began to think of going home and began to think
of the task of taking down his coat from behind the
door and of the task of getting into it.  He began to
think of the paper that had just gone to press and began
in his mind to go slowly through it from the first page,
enumerating the title of each article and of each
picture.  Somewhere after half-a-dozen pages he would
lose the thread and find himself miles away, occupied
with some other matter; then he would start again.
</p>

<p>
It was towards one o'clock when he realised that if
he did not move, he would miss a good train at Waterloo
and have a long wait before the next.  He decided against
the effort of taking down and getting into his coat.  He
took up his hat and stick and left the building by the
trade entrance at the back, meeting no one.  He followed
his usual habit of walking to Waterloo along the
Embankment, and it was nothing new to him&mdash;for a
press-night&mdash;that occasionally he found he could not keep a
straight course on the pavement.  Too many cigarettes,
he thought.  He crossed to the river side, and when he
was a little way from Waterloo Bridge, a more violent
swerve of his unsteady legs scraped him roughly against
the wall.  He had no control then, even over his limbs!
and at that realisation he stopped and laid his hands on
the wall and looked across the river and cried to himself
that frequent cry of these days: "Wriford!  Wriford!
Wriford!"
</p>

<p>
The wall was rough to his hands, and that produced
the thought of how soft his hands were&mdash;how contemptibly
soft he was all over and all through.  "Wriford!
Wriford!  Wriford!" cried Mr. Wriford to himself and
had a great surge through all his pulses that seemed&mdash;as
frequently in these days but now more violently, more
completely than ever before&mdash;to wash him asunder
from himself, so that he was two persons: one within
his body that was the Wriford he knew and hated, the
other that was himself, his own, real self, and that cried
to his vile, his hateful body: "Wriford!  Wriford!  Wriford!"
</p>

<p>
Intolerable&mdash;past enduring!  Mr. Wriford jumped
upwards, suspending his weight on his arms on the wall,
and by the action was dispossessed of other thought
than sudden recollection of exercises on the horizontal
bar at school; seemed to be in the gymnasium, and saw
the faces of forgotten school-fellows who were in his
gym set waiting their turn.  Then the Embankment
again and realisation.  Should he drop back to the
pavement?  "Wriford!  Wriford!  Wriford!"  He
mastered that vile, damned, craven body and threw up
his right leg and scrambled and pitched himself forward;
was conscious of striking his thigh violently against the
wall, and at the pain and as he fell, thought: "Ha,
that's one for you, damn you!  I've got you this time!
Got you!"  And then was in the river, and then
instinctively swimming, and then "Drown, damn you!
Drown!" cried Mr. Wriford and stopped the action of
his arms, and went down swallowing and struggling,
and came up struggling and choking, and instinctively
struck out again.
</p>

<p>
Shouts and running feet on the Embankment.
"Drown, damn you!  Drown, drown!" cried Mr. Wriford;
went down again, came up facing the wall, and
in the lamplight and in the tumult of his senses, saw
quite clearly a bedraggled-looking individual peering
down at him and quite clearly heard him call: "Nah,
then.  Nah, then.  Wot yer up to dahn there?"
</p>

<p>
Shouts and running feet on the police pier not thirty
yards away; sounds of feet in a boat; and then to
Mr. Wriford's whirling, smashing intelligence, the sight of
a boat&mdash;and what that meant.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford thrust his hands that he could not stop
from swimming into the tops of his trousers and twisted
his wrists about his braces.  "Drown, damn you!
Drown!" cried Mr. Wriford, and the whirling, smashing
scenes and noises lost coherence and only whirled and
smashed, and then a hand was clutching him, and
coherence returned, and Mr. Wriford screamed: "Let me go!
Let me go!" and freed an arm from the entanglement
of his braces and dashed it into the face bending over
him and with his fist struck the face hard.
</p>

<p>
"Shove him under," said the man at the oars.
"Shove him under.  He'll 'ave us over else...."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was lying in the boat.  "Let me go,"
cried Mr. Wriford.  "Let me go.  You're hurting
me."
</p>

<p>
"You've hurt me, you pleader," said the man, but
relaxed the knuckles that were digging into
Mr. Wriford's neck.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford moaned: "Well, why couldn't you let
me drown?  Why, in God's name, couldn't you let me
drown?"
</p>

<p>
"Not arf grateful, you beggars ain't," said the man;
and presently Mr. Wriford found himself pulled up from
the bottom of the boat and handed out on to the police
landing-stage to a constable with: "'Old 'im fast,
Three-Four-One.  Suicide, he is.  'Old 'im fast."
</p>

<p>
Three-Four-One responded with heavy hand
... conversation....  Mr. Wriford standing dripping,
sick, cold, beyond thought, presently walking across
the Embankment and up a street leading to the Strand
in Three-Four-One's strong grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you taking me?" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Bow Street," said Three-Four-One.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!" sobbed Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Not arf," said Three-Four-One.
</p>

<p>
Then a police whistle, shouts, running feet.  Round
the corner two men racing at top speed into Mr. Wriford
and Three-Four-One, and Mr. Wriford and Three-Four-One
sent spinning.  All to earth, and the two runners
atop, and a pursuing constable, unable to stop, upon the
four of them.  Blows, oaths, struggles.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford rolled free of the pack and got to his
feet, viewed a moment the struggle in progress before
him, then turned down the side-street whence the
pursuit had come, and ran; doubled up to the Strand and
across the Strand and ran and ran and ran; glanced over
his shoulder and saw one running, not after him, but
with him&mdash;wet as himself and very like himself.
"What do you want?" gasped Mr. Wriford.  The figure
made no reply but steadily ran with Mr. Wriford, and
Mr. Wriford recognised him and stopped.  "You're
Wriford, aren't you?" cried Mr. Wriford, and in sudden
paroxysm screamed: "Why didn't you drown?  Why
didn't you drown when I tried to drown you, curse
you?" and in paroxysm of hate struck the man across
his face.  He felt his own face struck but felt hurt no
more than when he had bruised his thigh in leaping
from the Embankment wall.  "Come on, then!" cried
Mr. Wriford.  "Come on, then, if you can!  I'll make
you sorry for it, Wriford.  Come on, then!"
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Wriford turned again, and with the figure
steadily beside him, ran and ran and ran and ran and
ran.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
ONE RUNS: ONE FOLLOWS
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Most dreadful pains of distressed breathing, of bursting
heart and of throbbing head, afflicted Mr. Wriford
as he ran.  He laboured on despite them.  He forgot,
too, that he had started running to escape arrest and
had run on&mdash;across the Strand, up Kingsway, through
Russell Square, across the Euston road and still on&mdash;in
terror of pursuit.  All that possessed him now was
fear and hatred of the one that ran steadily at his elbow,
whom constantly he looked at across his shoulder and
then would try to run faster, whom presently he faced,
halting in his run and at first unable to speak for the
agonies of his exertions.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Wriford said gaspingly: "Look here&mdash;you're
not to follow me.  Do you understand?" and
then cried, with sobbing breaths: "Go away!  Go
away, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
In the rays that came from an electric-light standard
near which they stood, Figure of Wriford seemed only
to grin in mock of these commands.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford waited to recover more regular breathing.
Then he said fiercely: "Look here!  Look across
the road.  There's a policeman there watching us.
D'you see him?  Well, are you going to leave me, or
am I going to give you in charge?  Now, then!"
</p>

<p>
Figure of Wriford only looked mockingly at him;
and first there came to Mr. Wriford a raging impulse
to strike him again, and then the knowledge that the
policeman was watching; and then Mr. Wriford stepped
swiftly across the road to carry out his threat; and
then, as he approached the policeman, had a sudden
realisation of the spectacle he must present&mdash;clothes
dripping, hat gone, collar ripped away&mdash;and for fear
of creating a scene, changed his intention.  But his first
impulse had brought him right up to the policeman.
He must say something.  He knew he was in the
direction of Camden Town.  He said nervously, trying to
control his laboured breathing: "Can you tell us the
way to Camden Town, please?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
This chanced to be a constable much used to the
oddities of London life and, by many years of senior
officer bullying and magisterial correction, cautious of
interference with the public unless supported by direct
Act of Parliament.  He awaited with complete unconcern
the bedraggled figure whose antics he had watched
across the road, and in reply to Mr. Wriford's hesitating:
"We want to get to Camden Town.  Can you tell
us the way, please," remarked over Mr. Wriford's head
and without bending his own: "Well, you've got what
you want.  It's all round you," and added, indulging
the humour for which he had some reputation: "That's
a bit of it you're holding down with your feet."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford looked at Figure of Wriford standing
by his side.  He looked so long with hating eyes, and was
so long occupied with the struggle to brave fear of a
scene and give the man in charge for following him, that
he felt some further explanation was due to the policeman
before he could move away.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Mr. Wriford.  "Thank you, we
rather thought we'd lost our way."
</p>

<p>
The policeman unbent a little and exercised his
humour afresh.  "Well, we've found it right enough,"
said he.  "What are us, by any chance?  King of
Proosia or Imperial Hemperor of Wot O She
Bumps?"
</p>

<p>
The constable's facetiousness was of a part with those
slights to his dignity from inferiors which always caused
Mr. Wriford insufferable humiliation.  It angered him
and gave him courage.  "Take that man in charge,"
cried Mr. Wriford sharply.  "He's following me.  I'm
afraid of him.  Take him in charge."
</p>

<p>
"What man?" said the constable.  "Don't talk so
stupid.  There's no man there."
</p>

<p>
"That man," cried Mr. Wriford.  "Are you drunk
or what?  Where's your Inspector?"
</p>

<p>
The constable, roused by this behaviour: "My
Inspector's where you'll be pretty sharp, if I have much
more of it&mdash;at the station!  Now, then!  Coming to
me with your us-es and your we-es!  'Op off out of it,
d'ye see?  'Op it an' quick."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford stared at him uncomprehendingly for a
moment and then screamed out: "I tell you that
man's following me.  What's he following me for?  He's
followed me miles.  I'm afraid of him.  Send him off.
Send him away."
</p>

<p>
The constable tucked his gloves in his belt and caught
Mr. Wriford strongly by the shoulder.  "Now, look
here," said the constable, "there's no man there, and
if you go on with your nonsense, you're Found Wandering
whilst of Unsound Mind, that's what you are.
You're asking for it, that's what you're doing, and in
less than a minute you'll get it, if you ain't careful.
Why don't you behave sensible?  What's the matter
with you?  Now, then, are you going to 'op it quiet, or
am I going to take you along?"
</p>

<p>
All manner of confusing ideas whirled in Mr. Wriford's
brain while the constable thus addressed him.
How, if he went to the Police Station, was he going to
explain who this man was that was following him?  The
man was himself&mdash;that hated Wriford.  Then who
was he?  Very bewildering.  Very difficult to explain.
Best get out of this and somehow give the man the
slip.  He addressed the constable quietly and with a
catch at his breath: "All right.  It's all right.  Never
mind."
</p>

<p>
The constable released him.  "Now do you know
where you live?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know; oh, I know," Mr. Wriford said.
</p>

<p>
"Got some one to look after you, waiting up for
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"Goin' to 'op it quiet?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes.  It's all right."
</p>

<p>
"Not goin' to give nobody in charge?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford stood away and wiped his eyes with the
back of his hand.  He said miserably: "No, it's all
right.  Only a bit of a quarrel.  It's nothing.  We'll go
on.  We're all right."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let me see you 'op it," said the policeman.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Mr. Wriford.  "All right," and he
walked on, still just catching his breath a little, and
puzzling, and watching out of the corner of his eyes
Figure of Wriford who came on beside him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
He walked on through Camden Town and through
Kentish Town, Figure of Wriford at his elbow.
Sometimes he would glance at Figure of Wriford and then
would begin to run.  Figure of Wriford ran with him.
Sometimes he would stop and stand still.  Figure of
Wriford also stopped, halting a little behind him.  Once
as he looked back at Figure of Wriford, he saw a
newspaper cart overtaking them, piled high with morning
papers, driving fast.  Mr. Wriford stepped off the
pavement and began to cross the road.  He judged very
exactly the distance at which Figure of Wriford
followed him.  When Figure of Wriford was right in the
cart's way, and he a pace or two beyond it, he suddenly
turned back and rushed for the pavement again.
</p>

<p>
"Now you're done for!" he shouted in Figure of
Wriford's face; but it was himself that the shaft struck
a glancing blow, staggering him to the path as the horse
was wrenched aside; and he was dizzied and scarcely
heard the shouts of abuse cursed at him by the driver,
as the cart went on and he was left groaning at the
violent hurt and shock he had suffered, Figure of Wriford
beside him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford walked on and on, planning schemes of
escape as he walked, and presently thought of one.
He was by now at Highgate Archway, and following
the way he had pursued, came upon the road that runs
through Finchley to Barnet and so in a great highway
to the country beyond.  Now early morning and early
morning's solitude had given place to the warmth and
opening activities of five o'clock&mdash;labourers passed to
their work, occasional tram-cars, scraping on their
overhead wires, came from Barnet or ran towards it.
Mr. Wriford was glad of the sun.  His running until he
met the policeman had overcome the chill of his
immersion in the river.  Since then, he had felt his soaked
clothing clinging about him, and his teeth chattered
and he shivered, very cold.  His exertions had run the
water off him.  Now the strong sun began to dry him.
Gradually, as he went on, the shivering ceased to mingle
with his breathing and only came to shake him in
spasmodic convulsions, very violent.  But his breathing
remained in catching sobs, and that was because of his
fear and hate of the one that trod at his elbow, and of
effort and resolution on the plan that should escape
him.
</p>

<p>
He began, as he approached the signs that indicated
halting-stations for the tram-cars, to hurry past them,
and when he was beyond a post, to dally and look
behind him for an overtaking car.  Several he allowed to
pass.  They were travelling too slowly for his purpose,
and Figure of Wriford was watching him very closely.
He came presently to a point where the road began to
descend gently in a long and straight decline.
</p>

<p>
Here cars passed very swiftly, and as one came speeding
while he was between halting-stations, Mr. Wriford
bound up his purpose and launched it.  The car whizzed
up to them; Mr. Wriford, looking unconcernedly ahead,
let it almost pass him, then he struck a savage blow at
Figure of Wriford and made a sudden and a wild dash
to scramble aboard.  The pole on the conductor's
platform was torn through his hands that clutched at it;
he grasped desperately at the back rail, stumbled, was
dragged, clung on, got a foot on the step, almost fell,
grabbed at the pole, drew himself aboard, and threw
himself against the conductor who had rushed down
from the top and, with one hand clutched at Mr. Wriford,
with the other was about to ring the bell.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's onset threw him violently against the
door, and Mr. Wriford, collapsed against him, cried:
"Don't ring!  Don't stop!" and then turned and at
what he saw, screamed: "Don't let that man get on!
Don't let him!  Throw him off!  Throw him off!  I tell
you, throw him&mdash;"  But the conductor, very angry,
shaken in the nerves and bruised against the door,
hustled Mr. Wriford within the car, and Mr. Wriford
saw Figure of Wriford following on the heels of their
scuffle; collapsed upon a seat and saw Figure of Wriford
take a place opposite him; began to moan softly to
himself and could not pay any attention to the
conductor's abuse.
</p>

<p>
"Serve you right," said the conductor very heatedly,
"if you'd broke your neck.  Jumpin' on my car like
that.  Serve you to rights if you'd broke your neck.
Nice thing for me if you had, I reckon.  I reckon it's
your sort what gets us poor chaps into trouble."  He
held on to an overhead strap, swayed indignantly above
Mr. Wriford, and obtaining no satisfaction from
him&mdash;sitting there very dejectedly, twisting his hands
together, little moans escaping him, tears standing in his
eyes&mdash;directed his remarks towards the single other
passenger in the car, who was a very stout workman
and who, responding with a refrain of: "Ah.  That's
right," induced the conductor to reiterate his charge
in order to earn a full measure of the comfort which
"Ah.  That's right" evidently gave him.
</p>

<p>
"Serve you right if you'd broke your neck," declared
the conductor.
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," agreed the stout workman.
</p>

<p>
"Your sort what gets us chaps into trouble, I
reckon."
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," the stout workman affirmed.
</p>

<p>
"Nice thing for me an' my mate," declared the
conductor, "to go before the Coroner.  Lose a day's work
and not 'arf lucky if we get off with that."
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," said the stout workman and spat
on the floor and rubbed it in with a stout boot, and as
if intellectually enlivened by this discharge, varied his
agreement to: "That's right, that is.  Ah."
</p>

<p>
"Serve you right&mdash;" began the conductor again, and
Mr. Wriford, acted upon by his persistence, said wearily:
"Well, never mind.  Never mind.  I'm all right now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I reckon you didn't ought to be," declared the
conductor.  "Not if I hadn't come down them steps
pretty sharp, you didn't ought."
</p>

<p>
The stout workman: "Ah.  That's right."
</p>

<p>
Now the conductor suddenly produced his tickets
and sharply demanded of Mr. Wriford: "Penny one?
Reckon you ought to pay double, you ought."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford as suddenly roused himself, looked across
at Figure of Wriford seated opposite, and as sharply
replied: "I'm not going to pay for him!  I won't pay
for him, mind you!"
</p>

<p>
The conductor followed the direction of Mr. Wriford's
eyes, looked thence towards the stout workman, and
then turned upon Mr. Wriford with: "Pay for yourself.
That's what you've got to do."
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," agreed the workman.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, breathing very hard, paid a penny, and
receiving his ticket, watched the conductor very
feverishly while he said: "Takes you to Barnet," and while
at last he turned away and stood against the entrance.
Then Mr. Wriford pointed to where Figure of Wriford
sat and cried: "Where's that man's ticket?"
</p>

<p>
The conductor looked at the stout workman and
tapped himself twice upon the forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," said the stout workman; and
thus supported, the conductor, no less a humourist than
the policeman of an hour before, informed Mr. Wriford,
with a wink at the stout workman: "He don't want no
ticket."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford appealed miserably: "Oh, why not?
Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"He rides free," said the conductor.  "That's what
he does," and while the stout workman agreed to this
with his usual formula, Mr. Wriford rocked himself to
and fro in his corner and said: "Oh, why did you let
him on?  Why did you let him on?  I asked you not to.
Oh, I asked you."
</p>

<p>
This caused much amusement to the conductor and
the stout workman, and at Barnet the conductor very
successfully launched two shafts of wit which he had
elaborated with much care.  As Mr. Wriford alighted,
"Wait for your friend," the conductor said, and as
Mr. Wriford paused with twisting face and then set off up
the road, turned for the stout workman's appreciation
and discharged his second brand.  "Reckon he
ought to ha' bin on a 'Anwell[<a id="chap0104fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn1">1</a>] car," said the
conductor.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0104fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0104fn1text">1</a>] Hanwell is the great lunatic asylum of London.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Ah.  That's right," said the stout workman.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford passed through Barnet and walked on to
the open country beyond, and still on and on throughout
the day.  He halted neither for rest nor refreshment.
Night came, and still he walked.  He had no thought of
sleep, but sleep stole upon his limbs.  He stumbled on a
grassy roadside, fell, did not rise again, and slept.  The
hours marched and brought him to new day.  He awoke,
looked at Figure of Wriford who sat wide-eyed beside
him, said "Oh&mdash;oh!" and walking all day long, said
no other word.
</p>

<p>
Dusk of the second evening stole across the fields and
massed ahead of him.  Mr. Wriford's progression was
now no more than a laboured dragging of one foot and
a slow placing it before the other.  He came at this gait
over the brow of a hill, and it revealed to him one at
whose arresting appearance and at whose greeting
Mr. Wriford for the first time stopped of his own will and
stood and stared, swaying upon his feet.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0105"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
ONE IS MET
</h3>

<p>
This was a somewhat tattered gentleman, very tall,
seated comfortably against the hedge, long legs stretched
before him, one terminating in a brown boot of good
shape, the other in a black, through which a toe
protruded.  This gentleman was shaped from the waist
upwards like a pear, in that his girth was considerable,
his shoulders very narrow, and his head and face like a
little round ball.  He ate, as he reclined there, from a
large piece of bread in one hand and a portion of cold
sausage in the other; and he appeared to be no little
incommoded as he did so, and as Mr. Wriford watched
him, by a distressing affliction of the hiccoughs which,
as they rent him, he pronounced <i>hup!</i>
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hup!</i>" said this gentleman with his mouth full; and
then again "<i>hup!</i>"  He then cleared his mouth, and
regarding Mr. Wriford with a jolly smile, upraised the
sausage in greeting and trolled forth in a very deep voice
and in the familiar chant:
</p>

<p>
"'O all ye tired strangers of the Lord, bless ye the
Lord: praise Him and magnify Him for ever'&mdash;<i>hup!</i>
</p>

<p>
"But you can't do that," continued the pear-shaped
gentleman, "when the famine has you in the vitals and
the soreness in the legs, as it has you, unless you've
practised it as much as I have.  Then it is both food and
rest.  In this wise&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hup!</i>&mdash;O all ye hungry of the Lord, bless ye the
Lord; praise Him and <i>hup</i>-nify Him for ever.
</p>

<p>
"Hunger, I assure you," said the pear-shaped gentleman,
"flee-eth before that shout as the wild goat before
the hunter.  Hunger or any ill.  I have known every ill
and defeated them all.  Selah!"
</p>

<p>
<a id="p59"></a>
There was about this unusual gentleman that which
doubly attracted Mr. Wriford.  The Mr. Wriford of a
very few days ago, who avoided eyes, who shrank from
strangers, would hurriedly and self-consciously have
passed him by.  The Mr. Wriford with whom Figure of
Wriford walked was attracted by the pear-shaped
gentleman's careless happiness and attracted much more by
his last words.  He came a slow step nearer the
pear-shaped gentleman, looked at Figure of Wriford, and
from him with eyes that signalled secrecy to the
pear-shaped gentleman, and in a low voice demanded: "You
have known every ill?  Have you ever been followed?"
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman stared curiously at
Mr. Wriford for a moment.  Then he said: "Not so much
followed, which implies interest or curiosity, as
chased&mdash;which betokens vengeance or heat.  With me that is
a common lot.  By dogs often and frequently bitten of
them.  By farmers a score time and twice assaulted.
By&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever been followed by yourself?" Mr. Wriford
interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman inclined his head to one
side and examined Mr. Wriford more curiously than
before.  "Have you come far?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"From Barnet," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Spare us!" said the pear-shaped gentleman with
much piety.  "Long on the road?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford looked at Figure of Wriford, and for the
first time since the event on the Embankment cast his
mind back along their companionship.  It seemed
immensely long ago; and at the thought of it, there
overcame Mr. Wriford a full and a sudden sense of his misery
that somehow unmanned him the more by virtue of
this, the first sympathetic soul he had met since he had
fled&mdash;since, as somehow it seemed to him, very long
before his flight.  He said, with a break in his voice and
his voice very weak: "I don't know how long we've
been.  We've been a long time."
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman inclined his head with a
jerk to the opposite side and took a long gaze at
Mr. Wriford from that position.  He then said: "How many
of you?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, a little surprise in his tone: "Why,
just we two."
</p>

<p>
"Hup!" said the pear-shaped gentleman, said it
with the violence of one caught unawares and considerably
startled, and then, recovering himself, directed
upon Mr. Wriford the same jolly smile with which he
had first greeted him, and again upraising the sausage,
trolled forth very deeply:
</p>

<p>
"O all ye loonies of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;
praise Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman then jumped to his feet
with an agility very conspicuous in one of his girth, and
of considerable purpose, in that he had no sooner
obtained his balance on his feet than Mr. Wriford lost his
balance upon his feet, swayed towards the arms
outstretched to him, was assisted to the hedgeside, and there
collapsed with a groan of very great fatigue.
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman on his knees, busying
himself with a long bottle and a tin can taken from the
grass, with a clasp knife, the cold sausage, and the
portion of bread: "I will have that groan into a shout
of praise before I am an hour nearer the grave or I am
no man.  Furthermore," continued the pear-shaped
gentleman, filling the can very generously and assisting
it very gently to Mr. Wriford's lips, "furthermore, I
will have no man groan other than myself, who groaneth
often and with full cause.  Your groan and your countenance
betokeneth much misery, and I will not be bested
by any man either in misery or in any other thing.  I
will run you, jump you, wrestle you, drink you, eat you,
whistle you, sing you, dance you&mdash;I will take you or
any man at any challenge; and this I will do with you
or any man for&mdash;win or lose&mdash;three fingers of whisky,
the which, <i>hup!</i> is at once my curse and my sole delight.
Selah!"
</p>

<p>
As he delivered himself of these remarkable sentiments,
the pear-shaped gentleman cut from the sausage
and the bread the portions to which his teeth had
attended, conveyed these to his own mouth, which again
became as full as when Mr. Wriford had first seen it,
and pressed the remainders upon Mr. Wriford with a
cordiality much aided by his jolly speech and by the
tin can of whisky which now ran very warmly through
Mr. Wriford's veins.  These combinations, indeed, and
the sight and then the taste of food awakened very
ferociously in Mr. Wriford the hunger which had now
for two days been gathering within him.  He ate
hungrily, and, in proportion as his faintness became
satisfied, something of an irresponsible light-headedness came
to him; he began to give little spurts of laughter at the
whimsicality of the pear-shaped gentleman and for the
first time to forget the presence of Figure of Wriford;
he accepted with no more reluctance than the same
nervous humour a final absurdity which, as night closed
about them, and as his meal was finished, the
pear-shaped gentleman pressed upon him.
</p>

<p>
"I can hardly keep awake," said Mr. Wriford and
lay back against the hedge.
</p>

<p>
The pear-shaped gentleman answered him from the
darkness: "Well, this is where we sleep&mdash;a softer
couch than any of your beds, and I have experienced
every sort.  The painful eructations which, to my great
though lawful punishment, my proneness for the whisky
puts upon me, are now, <i>hup!</i> almost abated, and I, too,
incline to slumber."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said sleepily: "You've been awfully
kind."
</p>

<p>
"I have conceived a fancy for you," said the
pear-shaped gentleman.  "I like your face, boy.  I call you
boy because you are youthful, and I am older than you:
in sin, curse me, as old as any man.  I also call you
loony, which it appears to me you are, and for which I
like you none the worse.  As an offset to the liberty,
you shall call me by any term you please."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford scarcely heard him.  "Well, I'd like to
know your name," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Puddlebox," said the pear-shaped gentleman; and
to Mr. Wriford's little spurt of sleepy laughter replied:
"A name that I claim to be all my own, for I will not
be beat at a name, nor at any thing, as I have told you,
by any man."
</p>

<p>
To this there was but a dreamy sigh from Mr. Wriford,
and Mr. Puddlebox inquired of him: "Sleepy?"
</p>

<p>
"Dog-tired," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Happy?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, you are much better, loony," said
Mr. Puddlebox.  He then put out a hand in the darkness,
and touching Mr. Wriford's ribs, obtained his fuller
attention.  "You are much better," repeated Mr. Puddlebox,
"and if you will give me your interest for a
last moment, we will continue in praise the cure which
we have begun very satisfactorily in good whisky, cold
sausage, and new bread.  A nightly custom of mine
which I suit according to the circumstances and in which,
being suited to you, you shall now accompany me."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Mr. Wriford, aroused, and laughed
again in light-hearted content.  "Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mr. Puddlebox, "thusly," and trolled
forth very deeply into the darkness:
</p>

<p>
"O all ye loonies of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;
praise Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Now you," said Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford protested with nervous laughter: "It's
too ridiculous!"
</p>

<p>
"It's wonderfully comforting," said Mr. Puddlebox;
and Mr. Wriford laughed again and in a voice that
contrasted very thinly with the volume of Mr. Puddlebox's
gave forth as requested:
</p>

<p>
"O all ye loonies of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise
Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Scarcely body enough," adjudged Mr. Puddlebox,
"but that will come with appreciation of its value.
Now one other, and this time touching that friend of
yours whom I name Spook.  We have starved him to his
great undoing, for you have fed while he has hungered,
and his bowels are already weakened upon you.  We will
now further discomfort him with praise.  This time
together&mdash;O all ye Spooks.  Now, then."
</p>

<p>
"It's absurd," said Mr. Wriford.  "It's too ridiculous";
but in the midst of his laughter at it had a
sudden return to Figure of Wriford who was the subject
of it and cried out: "Oh, what shall I do?  Oh, what
shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, there you go!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "There's
the necessity of it.  Fight against him, boy.  Let him
not beat you, nor any such.  Quick now&mdash;O all ye&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Wriford groaned, then laughed in a nervous
little spurt, then groaned again, then weakly quavered
while Mr. Puddlebox strongly belled:
</p>

<p>
"O all ye spooks of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;
praise Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Feel better?" questioned Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness only some stifled sounds answered
him.
</p>

<p>
"Crying, loony?"
</p>

<p>
Only those sounds.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox put out a large hand, felt for
Mr. Wriford's hands and clasped it upon them.  "Hold
my hand, boy."
</p>

<p>
Sleep came to them.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
FIGHTING IT: TELLING IT
</h3>

<p>
This was a large, fat, kindly and protective hand in
whose comfort Mr. Wriford slept, beneath which he
awoke, and whose aid he was often to enjoy in
immediate days to come.  Yet its influence over him was by
no means always apparent.  Increasing acquaintance
with Mr. Puddlebox was needed for its development,
and this had illustration in the manner of his first sleep
by Mr. Puddlebox's side.
</p>

<p>
Thus at first Mr. Wriford, clutching like a child at the
hand which came to him in the darkness, and no little
operated upon by intense fatigue, by the whisky, and
by the meal of cold sausage and bread, slept for some
hours very soundly and without dreams.  Next his
state became troubled.  His mind grew active while
yet his body slept.  Very disturbing visions were
presented to him, and beneath them he often moaned.
They rode him hard, and ridden by them he began to
find his unaccustomed couch first comfortless and then
distressing.  A continuous, tremendous, and rasping
sound began to mingle with and to be employed by his
visions.  He sat up suddenly, threw off Mr. Puddlebox's
hand in bewildered fear of it, then saw that the
enormous raspings proceeded from Mr. Puddlebox's nose
and open mouth, and then remembered, and then saw
Figure of Wriford seated before him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford caught terribly at his breath and with
the action drew up his knees.  He placed his elbows on
them and covered his face with his hands.  He pressed
his fingers together, but through their very flesh he yet
could see Figure of Wriford quite plainly, grinning at
him.  Hatred and fear gathered in Mr. Wriford amain.
With them he drew up all the fibres of his body, drew his
heels closer beneath him, prepared to spring fiercely
at the intolerable presence, then suddenly threw his
hands from him and at the other's throat, and cried
aloud and sprung.
</p>

<p>
He struggled.  He fought.  Figure of Wriford was
screaming at him, and in that din, and in the din of
bursting blood within his brain, he heard Mr. Puddlebox
also shouting at him strangely.  "Glumph him, boy,"
Mr. Puddlebox shouted.  "Glumph him, glumph him!"  And
there was Mr. Puddlebox hopping bulkily about
him as he fought and struggled and staggered, and
desperately sickened, and desperately strove to keep his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"Help me!" choked Mr. Wriford.  "Help me!
Help me!  Kill him!  Kill!  Kill!"
</p>

<p>
"Kill yourself!" came Mr. Puddlebox's voice.
"You're killing yourself!  You're killing yourself!  Why,
what the devil?  You're fighting yourself, boy.  You're
fighting yourself.  Loose him, boy!  Loose him!  You've
got him beat!  Loose him now, loose him&mdash;<i>Ooop!</i>"
</p>

<p>
This bitter cry of "<i>Ooop!</i>" unheeded by Mr. Wriford,
was shot out of agony to Mr. Puddlebox's black-booted
foot, upon the emerging toes of which Mr. Wriford's
heel came with grinding force.  "<i>Ooop!</i>" bawled
Mr. Puddlebox and hopped away upon the shapely brown
boot, the other foot clutched in his hands, and then
<i>"Ooop!</i>" again&mdash;"<i>Ooop!  Erp!  Blink!</i>"  For there
crashed upon his nose a smashing fist of Mr. Wriford's
arm, and down he went, blood streaming, and
Mr. Wriford atop of him, and Mr. Wriford's head with
stunning force against a telegraph pole, thence to an ugly
stone.
</p>

<p>
Stillness then of movement; and of sounds only
immense gurgling and snuffling from Mr. Puddlebox,
lamentably engaged upon his battered nose.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford sat up.  He pressed a hand to his head
and presently, his chest heaving, spoke with sobbing
breaths.  "You might have helped me," he sobbed.
"You might have helped me."
</p>

<p>
From above his dripping nose, Mr. Puddlebox
regarded him dolorously.  He had no speech.
</p>

<p>
"You might have helped me," Mr. Wriford moaned.
</p>

<p>
"Glug," said Mr. Puddlebox thickly.  "Glug.
Blink!"
</p>

<p>
"When you saw me&mdash;" Mr. Wriford cried.
</p>

<p>
"Glug," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "Blink!  Helped
you!" he then cried.  "Why, look what the devil I have
helped you!  Glug.  If I have bled a pint, I have bled
a quart, and at this flood I shall ungallon myself to
death.  Glug.  Blink.  Why, I was no less than a fool
ever to come near you.  Might have helped you!
Glug!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's common politeness came to him.  With
some apology in his tone, "I don't know how you got
that," he said.  "I only&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, very woefully from behind a blood-red
cloth: "I don't know how I shall ever get over it."  But
he was by now a little better of it, the flow somewhat
staunched, and he said with a vexation that he justified
by glances at the soaking cloth between dabs of it at
his nose: "Why, I helped you in all I could.  You
fought like four devils.  I was in the very heart of it.
</p>

<p>
"I heard you," said Mr. Wriford, "shouting 'Glumph
him!' or some such word.  It was no help to&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox returned crossly.  "Glumph him!
Certainly I&mdash;glug.  Blink!  There it is off again.  Glug.
Certainly I shouted glumph him.  A glumph is a fat
hit&mdash;a hit without art or science, and the only sort of
which I am capable, or you, either, as I saw at a glance.
Glug."
</p>

<p>
"I was fighting," said Mr. Wriford.  "I was being
killed, and you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why, I was being killed also," returned Mr. Puddlebox.
"Look at my foot.  Look at my nose.  Fighting!
Why, there never was such senseless fighting&mdash;never.
Glug.  Blink!  Why, beyond that you fought with me
whenever I came near you, who to the devil do you
think you were fighting with?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford looked at him with very troubled eyes.
After a little while, "Why, tell me whom," he said.  "I
want to know."  His voice ran up and he cried: "It's
not right!  I want to know."
</p>

<p>
"Why, loony," said Mr. Puddlebox kindly, suddenly
losing his heat and his vexation, "why, loony, you were
fighting yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Mr. Wriford answered him hopelessly.  "Yes.
That's it.  Myself that follows me," and he moaned and
wrung his hands, rocking himself where he sat.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox supported his nose with his blood-red
cloth and waddled to Mr. Wriford on his knees.  He sat
himself on his heels and wagged a grave finger before
Mr. Wriford's face.  "Now look here, boy," said
Mr. Puddlebox.  "When I say you, I mean you&mdash;that
you," and he dug the finger at Mr. Wriford's chest.
"When I say fought yourself, I mean your own
hands&mdash;those hands, at your own throat&mdash;that throat."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox spoke so impressively, looking so
strongly and yet so kindly at Mr. Wriford, that great
wonder and trouble came into Mr. Wriford's eyes, and
he put his fingers to his throat, that was red and scarred
and tender, and said wonderingly, doubtfully, pitifully:
"Do you mean that I did this to myself&mdash;with my own
hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, certainly I do," returned Mr. Puddlebox,
"and with your own hands this to my nose.  Why, I
awoke with a kick that you gave me, and there you were,
dancing over there with sometimes your hands squeezing
the life out of yourself, black in the face, and your eyes
like to drop out, and sometimes your hands smashing
at nothing except when they smashed me, and screaming
at the top of your voice, and your feet staggering and
plunging&mdash;why, you were like to have torn yourself
to bits, but that you fell, and the pole here knocked
sense into you.  Like this you had yourself," and
Mr. Puddlebox took his throat in his hands in illustration,
"and shook yourself so," and shook his head violently
and ended "Glug.  Curse me.  I've started it again.
Glug," and mopped his nose anew.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said in horror, more to himself than
aloud: "Why, that's madness!"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;glug, blink!" said Mr. Puddlebox.  "Why,
that's what it will be if you let it run, boy.  That's what
will be, if you are by yourself, which you shall not be,
for I like your face, and I will teach you to glumph it
out of you.  This is a spook that you think you see, and
that is why I call you loony, and it is no more a real
thing than the several things I see when the whisky is
in me, as I have taught myself&mdash;glug, I shall bleed to
death&mdash;as I have taught myself to know, and as I
shall teach you.  Wherefore we are henceforward
comrades, for you are not fit to take care of yourself till
this thing is out of you.  We shall now breakfast,"
continued Mr. Puddlebox, beginning with one hand, the
other kept very gingerly to his nose, to feel towards his
bundle on the grass, "and you shall tell me who you
are, and why you are spooked, first unspooking yourself,
as last night, with praise.  Come now, we will have
them both together&mdash;O ye loonies and spooks&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I won't!" said Mr. Wriford.  He sat with his hands
to his chin, his knees drawn up, wrestling in a fevered
mind with what facts came out of Mr. Puddlebox's
jargon.  "I won't!"
</p>

<p>
"It is very comforting," said Mr. Puddlebox, not at
all offended.  "Try breakfast first, then."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let me alone," cried Mr. Wriford.  "I don't
want breakfast."
</p>

<p>
"I do," returned Mr. Puddlebox.  "The more so
that I have lost vast blood.  There is enough whisky
here to invigorate me, yet, under Providence, not to
plague me with the hiccoughs.  Also good cold bacon.
Come, boy, cold bacon."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want it," Mr. Wriford said.
</p>

<p>
"More for me," said Mr. Puddlebox, "and I want
much.  While I eat, you shall tell me how you come to
be loony, and I will then tell you how I come to be what
I am.  And I will tell a better story than you or than any
man.  Come now!"
</p>

<p>
An immense bite of the cold bacon then went to
Mr. Puddlebox's mouth, and Mr. Wriford, looking up,
found himself so jovially and affectionately beamed upon
through the bite, that he suddenly turned towards
Mr. Puddlebox and said: "I'll tell you.  I'd like to tell
you.  You've been very kind to me.  I've never said
thank you.  I'm ill.  I don't know what I am."
</p>

<p>
Gratified sounds from Mr. Puddlebox's distended
mouth&mdash;inarticulate for the cold bacon that impeded
them, but sufficiently interpreted by quick nods of the
funny little round head and by smiles.
</p>

<p>
"It's very strange to me," said Mr. Wriford in a low
voice, "to be sitting here like this and talking to you.
I don't know how I do it.  A little while ago I was in
London, and I couldn't have done it then.  I never
spoke to anybody that I could help&mdash;I remember that.
I say I can remember that, because there are a lot of
things I can't remember.  I've been like that a long
time.  I've never told anybody before.  I don't know
how I tell you now&mdash;I said that just now, didn't I?"
and Mr. Wriford stopped and looked at Mr. Puddlebox
in a puzzled way.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, cheeks much distended, first shook
his head very vigorously and then as vigorously
nodded it.  This thoughtfully left it to Mr. Wriford to
choose whichever distressed him less, and he said: "In
the middle of thinking of a thing it goes."  There was a
rather pitiful note in Mr. Wriford's voice, and he sat
dejectedly in silence.  When next he spoke, he shook
himself, and as though the action shook off his former
mood, he said excitedly, bending forward towards
Mr. Puddlebox: "Look here, I've never done things!  I've
been shut up.  I've had things to look after.  I've never
been able to rest.  I've never been able to be quiet.
There's always been something else.  There's always
been something all round me, like walls&mdash;oh, like
walls!  Always getting closer.  I've never been able to
stop.  No peace.  There's always been some trouble&mdash;something
to think about that grinds me up, and in the
middle of it something else.  There's always been
something hunting me.  Always something, and always
something else waiting behind that.  Like walls, closer
and closer.  I never could get away.  I tell you, every
one I ever met had something for me that kept me.  I
wanted to scream at them to let me alone.  I never
could get away.  I was shut up.  I'm a writer.  I write
newspapers and books.  People know me&mdash;people who
write.  I hate them all.  I've often looked at people and
hated everybody.  They look at me and see what I am
and laugh at me.  They know I'm frightened of them.
I'm frightened because I've been shut up, and that's
made me different from other people.  I'm a writer.
I've made much more money than I want.  I've looked
at people in trains and places and known I could have
bought them all up ten times over.  And the money's
never been any use to me&mdash;not when you're shut up,
not when there's always something else, not when you're
always trembling.  I never can make people understand.
They don't know I'm shut up.  They don't see that
there's always something else.  They think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford stopped and looked again in a puzzled
way at Mr. Puddlebox and then said apologetically:
"I don't know how I've come here.  I don't understand
it just at present.  I'll think of it in a minute;" and
then broke out suddenly and very fiercely: "But I
tell you, although you say it isn't, and God only knows
why you should interfere or what it's got to do with
you, I tell you that I've had myself walking with me
and want to kill it.  And I will kill it!  It's done things to
me.  It's kept me down.  I hate it.  It's been me for a
long time.  But it isn't me!  I'm different.  I can look
back when you never knew me, and God knows how
different I've been&mdash;young and happy!  I want to die.
If you want to know, though what the devil it's got to
do with&mdash;I want to die, die, die!  I want to get out
of it all.  Yes, now I remember.  That's it.  I want to
get out of it all.  Everything's all round me, close to me.
I can scarcely breathe.  I want to get out of it.  I've
been in it long enough.  I want to smash it all up.  Smash
it with my hands to blazes.  My name's Wriford.  If
you don't believe it, you can ask any one in London
who knows about newspapers and books, and they'll
tell you.  I'm Wriford, and I want to get out of it all.
I want to kill myself and get away alone.  I won't have
myself with me any longer!  Damn him, he's a vile
devil, and he isn't me at all.  I'm Wriford!  Good Lord,
before I began all this, I used to be&mdash;  He's a vile,
cowardly devil.  I want to get away from him and get
away by myself.  I want to smash it all up.  With my
hands I want to smash it and get away alone&mdash;alone;"
and then Mr. Wriford stopped with chest heaving and
with burning eyes, and then tore open his coat and then
his shirt, as though his body burned and he would have
the air upon it.
</p>

<p>
All this time Mr. Puddlebox had been champing
steadily with mouth prodigiously filled.  Now he washed
down last fragments of cold bacon with last dregs of
good whisky and, with no sort of comment upon
Mr. Wriford's story or condition, announced: "Now I will
tell you my story.  That's fair.  Then we shall know
each other as comrades should; which, as I have said,
we are to be henceforward and until I have unspooked
you.  Furthermore, as I also said, I will tell a better
story than you&mdash;yes, or than any man, for I will take
you or any man at any thing and give best to none.
Selah."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
HEARING IT
</h3>

<p>
"My name is Puddlebox," said Mr. Puddlebox.  He
settled his back comfortably against the hedge and
looked with a very bright eye at Mr. Wriford, who sat
bowed before him and who at this beginning, and
catching Mr. Puddlebox's merry look, shook himself
impatiently and averted his eyes, that were pained and
troubled, to the ground, as though he would hear
nothing of it and wished to be wrapped in his own concerns.
</p>

<p>
Not at all discouraged, "My name is Puddlebox,"
Mr. Puddlebox continued.  "I was born many highly
virtuous years ago in the ancient town of Hitchin, which
lies not far from us as we sit.  My father was an
ironmonger, of good business and held in high esteem by
all who knew him.  My mother was an ironer, and love,
which, as I have marked, will make use of any bond,
perhaps attracted these two by medium of the iron upon
which each depended for livelihood.  My mother sang
in the choir of her chapel, and my father, who
sometimes preached there, has told me that she presented a
very holy and beautiful picture as the sun streamed
through the window and fell upon her while she hymned.
Here again," continued Mr. Puddlebox, "the ingenuity
of love is to be observed, for this same sunlight, though
it adorned my mother, also incommoded her, and my
father, in his capacity as ironmonger, was called upon to
fit a blind for her greater convenience.  This led to their
acquaintance and, in process of lawful time, to me whom
they named Eric.  Little Eric.  Five followed me.  I
was the eldest, and the most dutiful, of six.  Offspring
of God-fearing parents, I was brought up in the paths
of diligence and rectitude&mdash;trained in the way I should
go and from my earliest years pursued that way without
giving my parents one single moment's heart-burning
or doubt.  I was, and I have ever been, a little ray of
sunshine in their lives."
</p>

<p>
"You're a tramp, aren't you?" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
On the previous evening Mr. Puddlebox had induced
in Mr. Wriford a mood in which his griefs had
disappeared before little spurts of involuntary laughter.
The same, arising out of Mr. Puddlebox's whimsical
narration of his grotesque story, threatened him now,
and he resisted it.  He resisted it as a vexed child, made
to laugh despite himself, seeks by cross yet half-laughing
rejoinders to preserve his ill-humour and not be wheedled
out of it.
</p>

<p>
"You're a tramp, aren't you?" said Mr. Wriford;
but Mr. Puddlebox, with no notice of the interruption,
continued: "A little ray of sunshine.  My dear parents
in time sent me to school.  Here, by my diligence and
aptitude, I brought at once great shame upon my elder
classmates and great pride to the little parlour behind
the ironmonger's shop.  It became furnished, that
pleasant parlour, with my prize-books, and decorated
with my medals and certificates of punctuality and
good conduct.  As I grew older, so the ray of sunshine
which I effulged waxed brighter and warmer.  My
father, encouraged and advised by my teachers, offered
me the choice of many lucrative and gentlemanly
professions.  It was suggested that I should embrace a few
of the many scholarships that were at the easy
command of my abilities and my industry, proceed to the
University, and become pedagogue, pastor, or lawyer.
I well remember, and I remember it with pride and
happiness, the grateful mingling of my parents' tears
when I announced that I spurned these attractions,
desiring only to be apprenticed to my dear father's
business, perpetuate the grand old name of Puddlebox,
ironmonger, Hitchin, and become the prop and
comfort of the evening of my parents' years.
</p>

<p>
"This was the time," proceeded Mr. Puddlebox,
"when, in common with all youth, I was subjected to
the temptations of gross and idle companions.  As I
had shamed my classmates at school, so I shamed my
would-be betrayers in the street.  They called me to the
pleasures of the public-house.  I pointed to the
blue-ribbon badge of my pledges against intoxicating liquors.
They enticed me to ribaldry, to card-playing, to laughter
with dangerous women.  I openly rebuked them and
besought them for their own good instead to sit with
me of an evening, while I read aloud from devotional
works to my dear parents.  My spare time I devoted
to my Sunday-school class, to the instruction of my
younger brothers and sisters, and to profitable reading.
My recreation took the form of adorning our chapel
with the arts of turnery and joinery which I had learnt
together with that of pure ironmongery."
</p>

<p>
All this was more and more punctuated with spurts
of laughter from Mr. Wriford, and now, laughing openly,
"Well, when did all this stop?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"It never stopped," returned Mr. Puddlebox.  "A
calamitous incident diverted it to another train; that
is all.  Five sovereigns, nine shillings, and fourpence
were one day found to be missing from the till.  It
was in the till when the shop was shut at seven o'clock
one Saturday night, and it was out of the till when my
father went to transfer it to the cash-box at eight
o'clock.  We kept no servant.  No stranger had entered
the house.  The theft lay with one of my brothers and
sisters.  My father's passion was terrible to witness.
That a child of his should rob his own father produced
in him a paroxysm of wrath such as even I, well knowing
his sternly religious nature, did not believe him capable
of.  With shaking voice he demanded of my brothers
and sisters severally and collectively who had brought
this shame upon him.  All denied it.  I was in an
adjoining room&mdash;as horrified and as trembling as my
father.  I knew the culprit.  I had seen a Puddlebox&mdash;a
Puddlebox!&mdash;with his hand in his father's till.  My
long discipline in virtue and in filial and fraternal
devotion told me at once what I must do.  I must shield
the culprit; I must take the blame upon myself."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"I did not hesitate a moment," said Mr. Puddlebox,
disregarding the question.  "Breathing a rapid prayer
for my dear ones' protection and for the forgiveness of
the culprit, I turned instantly and fled from the house.
I have never seen my parents since.  I have never again
revisited the ancestral home of the Puddleboxes.  Yet
am I content and would not have it otherwise, for I am
happy in the knowledge that I have saved the culprit.
Since then, I have devoted my life over a wider area to
the good works which formerly I practised within the
municipal boundaries of beloved Hitchin.  I tour the
countryside in a series of carefully planned ambits,
seeking, by ministration to the sick and needy, to shed
light and happiness wherever I go, supporting myself
by those habits of diligence and sobriety which became
rooted in me in my childhood's years.  You say your
name is Wriford, and that you are of repute in London.
My name is Puddlebox, and I am known, respected, and
welcomed in a hundred villages, boroughs, and urban
districts.  Now that is my story," concluded
Mr. Puddlebox, "and I challenge you to say that yours is a
better."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was by this time completely won out of
the fierce and tumultuous thoughts that had possessed
him when Mr. Puddlebox began.  His little spurts of
involuntary laughter had become more frequent and
more openly daring as Mr. Puddlebox proceeded, and
now, quite given over to a nervously light-headed state
such as may be produced in one by incessant tickling,
he laughed outright and declared: "I don't believe a
word of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mr. Puddlebox, merrier than ever in
the eye, and speaking with a curious note of triumph as
though this were precisely what he had been aiming at,
"Well, I don't believe a word of yours!"
</p>

<p>
"Mine's true," cried Mr. Wriford, quick and sharp,
and got indignantly to his feet.  Habit of thought of
the kind that had helped work his destruction in him
jumped at him at this, as he took it, flat insult to his
face, and in the old way set him surging in head and
heart at the slight to his dignity.  "Mine's true!" he
cried and looked down hotly at Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
"And mine's as true," said Mr. Puddlebox equably
and giving him only the same merry eye.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, heaving: "Why, you said
yourself&mdash;only last night&mdash;that whisky was your curse.  You've
told me a lot of rubbish; you couldn't have meant it for
anything else.  I've told you facts.  What don't you
believe?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't believe any of it," said Mr. Puddlebox, and
at Mr. Wriford's start and choke, added quickly: "as
you tell it."
</p>

<p>
One of those sudden blanks, one of those sudden
snappings of the train of thought&mdash;<i>click!</i> like an actual
snapping in the brain&mdash;came to Mr. Wriford.  One
of those floodings about his mind of immense and
whirling darkness in which desperately his mental eye
sought to peer, and desperately his mental hands to
grope.  He tried to remember what it was that he had
told Mr. Puddlebox.  He tried to search back among
recent moments that he could remember&mdash;or thought
he remembered&mdash;for words he must have spoken but
could not recollect.  His indignation at Mr. Puddlebox's
refusal to believe him disappeared before this anguish
and the trembling that it gave.  He made an effort to
hold his own, not to betray himself, and with it cried
indignantly: "Well, what did I say?" then, unable to
sustain it, abandoned himself to the misery and the
helplessness, and used again the same words, but
pitiably.  "Well, what did I say?" Mr. Wriford asked
and caught his breath in a sob.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox put that large, soft, fat, kindly and
protective hand against Mr. Wriford's leg that stood
over him and pulled on the trouser.  "Now, look here,
boy," said Mr. Puddlebox very soothingly, "sit here by
me, and I will tell you what you said, and we will put
this to the rights of it."
</p>

<p>
Very dejectedly Mr. Wriford sat down; very
protectively Mr. Puddlebox put the large hand on his
knee and patted it.  "Now, look here, my loony," said
Mr. Puddlebox, "I'll tell you what you said, and what
I mean by saying I don't believe a word of it as you tell
it.  What I mean, my loony, is that there's one thing
the same in your story and in mine, and it is the same
in every story that I hear from folks along the road,
and I challenge you or any man to hear as many as I
have heard.  It is that we've both been glumphed, boy.
We've both led beautiful, virtuous lives and ought to
be angels with beautiful wings&mdash;'stead of which, here
we are: glumphed; folks have got up and given us fat
hits and glumphed us.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's two ways," continued Mr. Puddlebox
with great good humour, "there's two ways of telling
a glumphed story, my loony: the way of the glumphed,
which I have told to you, and the way of the glumpher,
which I now shall tell you.  Take my story first, boy.
Glumphed, which is me, tells you of a child and a boy
and a youth which was the pride and the comfort and
the support of his parents; glumphers, which is they,
would tell you I was their shame and their despair.
Glumphed: diligent, shaming his classmates, adorning
the parlour with prize-books; glumphers: never learning
but beneath the strap, idle, disobedient.  Glumphed:
spurning companions who would entice him; glumphers:
leading companions astray.  Glumphed: putting away
nobler callings and desirous only to serve his father in
the shop; glumphers: wasting his parents' savings that
would educate him for the ministry, and of the shop
sick and ashamed.  Glumphed: reading devotional
books to his mother; glumphers: breaking her heart.
Glumphed: knowing the culprit who robbed his father
and fleeing to save him; glumphers: himself the thief
and running away from home.  Glumphed: journeying
the countryside in good works and everywhere respected;
glumphers: a tramp and a vagabond, plagued with
whisky and everywhere known to the police.
</p>

<p>
"There's a difference for you, boy," concluded
Mr. Puddlebox; and he had recited it all so comically as
once again to bring Mr. Wriford out of dejection and
set him to the mood of little spurts of laughter.
"Glumphed," Mr. Puddlebox had said, raising one
fat hand to represent that individual and speaking for
him in a very high squeak; and then "glumphers" with
the other fat hand brought forward and his voice a very
sepulchral bass.  Now he turned his merry eyes full
upon Mr. Wriford: and Mr. Wriford met them laughingly
and laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I see what you're driving at," Mr. Wriford laughed;
"but it doesn't apply to me, you know.  You don't
suppose I've&mdash;er&mdash;robbed tills, or&mdash;well&mdash;done
your kind of thing, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you've done," said Mr. Puddlebox.
"But this I do know, that your story is the same
as my story, and the same as everybody's story, in this
way that you've never done anything wrong in your
life, and that all your troubles are what other
folks&mdash;glumphers&mdash;have done to you.  Well, whoa, my loony,
whoa!" cried Mr. Puddlebox, observing protest and
indignation blackening again on Mr. Wriford's face.
"The difference in your case is that what you've done
and think you haven't done has spooked you, boy, and
now I will tell you how you are spooked; and how I
will unspook you.  You think too much about yourself,
boy.  That's what is spooking you.  You think about
yourself until you've come to see yourself and to be
followed by yourself.  Well, you've got to get away
from yourself.  That's what you want, boy&mdash;you
know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm followed," Mr. Wriford cried.  He clutched
at Mr. Puddlebox's last words; and, at the understanding
that seemed to be in them, forgot all else that had
been said and cried entreatingly: "I'm followed,
followed!"
</p>

<p>
"I will shake him off," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "You
want to get away?"
</p>

<p>
"I must!" said Mr. Wriford.  "I must!"
</p>

<p>
"And you don't mind what happens to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind anything."
</p>

<p>
"Why, then, cheer up," cried Mr. Puddlebox with a
sudden infectious burst of spirits, "for I don't, either;
and so there are two of us, and the world is full of fun
for those who mind nothing.  I will teach you to sing,
and I will teach you to find in everything measure for
my song, which is of praise and which is:
</p>

<p>
"O ye world of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise
Him and magnify Him for ever.
</p>

<p>
"Up, my loony, and I will teach you to forget yourself,
which is what is the matter with you and with
most of us."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox with these words got very nimbly to
his feet, and there took Mr. Wriford a sudden infection
of Mr. Puddlebox's spirits, which made him also jump
up and stand with this jolly and pear-shaped figure who
minded nothing, and look at him and laugh in irresponsible
glee.  Mr. Puddlebox wore a very long and very
large tail-coat, in the pockets of which he now began to
stuff his empty bottle, a spare boot, what appeared to
be a shirt in which other articles were rolled, and sundry
other packets which he picked up from the grass about
him.  Upon his head he wore a hard felt hat whose rim
was gone, so that it sat upon him like an inverted basin;
and about his considerable waist he now proceeded to
wind a great length of string.  He presented, when his
preparations were done, so completely odd and so jolly
a figure that Mr. Wriford laughed aloud again and felt
run through him a surge of reckless irresponsibility;
and Mr. Puddlebox laughed in return, loud and long,
and looking down the hill observed: "We will now
leave this place of blood and wounds and almost of
unseemly quarrel.  Ascending towards us I observe a
wagon, stoutly horsed.  We will attach ourselves to
the back of it and place ourselves entirely at its
disposal; first greeting the wagoner in song, for the very
juice of life is to be extracted by finding matter for
praise in all things.  Now, then, when he reaches
us&mdash;'O ye wagoners&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
The wagon reached them.  Piled high with sacks, it
was drawn by three straining horses and driven by a
very burly gentleman who sat on a seat above his team
and midway up the sacks and scowled very blackly at
the pair who awaited him and who, as he drew abreast,
gave him, Mr. Puddlebox with immense volume and
Mr. Wriford with gleeful irresponsibility:
</p>

<p>
"O ye wagoners of the Lord, bless ye the Lord;
praise Him and magnify Him for ever!"
</p>

<p>
The wagoner's reply was to spit upon the ground for
the singers' benefit and very brutally to lash his team
for his own.  The horses strained into a frightened and
ungainly plunging, and the wagon lumbered ahead.
Mr. Puddlebox plunged after it, and Mr. Wriford,
with light-headed squirms of laughter, after Mr. Puddlebox.
The tail-board of the wagon was not high above
the road.  In a very short space Mr. Wriford was seated
upon it and then clutching and hauling in assistance of
the prodigious bounds and scrambles with which, at
last, Mr. Puddlebox also effected the climb.
</p>

<p>
And so away, with dangling legs.

BOOK TWO
<br /><br />
ONE OF THE JOLLY ONES
</h2>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
INTENTIONS, BEFORE HAVING HIS HAIR CUT, OF A WAGONER
</h3>

<p>
In this company, and with this highly appropriate
beginning of legs dangling carelessly above the dusty
highroad from a stolen seat on the tail-board of a wagon,
there began to befall Mr. Wriford many adventures
which, peculiar and unusual for any man, were, for one
of Mr. Wriford's station in life and of his character
and antecedents, in the highest degree extraordinary.
His dangling legs&mdash;and the fact that he swung them
as they dangled&mdash;were, indeed, emblematic of the
frame of mind which took him into these adventures
and which&mdash;save when the old torments clutched him
and held him&mdash;carried him through each and very
irresponsibly into the next.  Through all the later
years of his former life he had very much cared what
happened to him and what people thought of him when
they looked at him.  He was filled now with a spirit
of not caring at all.  It was more than a reckless spirit;
it was a conscious spirit.  He had often, in the days of
his torment, cried aloud that he wished he might die.
He told himself now that he did not mind if he did die,
and did not mind if he was hurt or what suffering befell
him.  Through all the later years of his former life he
often had cried aloud, his brain most dreadfully surging,
his panic desire to get out of it all.  He told himself that
he now was out of it all.  He had been frantic to be free;
he now was free.  A very giddiness of freedom possessed
him and caused him, at the dizziness of it, to
laugh aloud.  A very intoxication of irresponsibility
filled him and caused in him a fierce lust to exercise it in
feats of maddest folly.  He only wanted to laugh, as
before he very often had wanted to cry or scream.  He
only wanted to perform wild, senseless pranks, as before
he only had desired to be shut away from people&mdash;by
himself, alone, in the dark.  All this increased with every
day of the early days in Mr. Puddlebox's company.
Now, as he sat beside Mr. Puddlebox on the tail-board
of the wagon, and swung his legs and often laughed
aloud, he sometimes reflected upon where the wagon
was taking them and what would happen, and at the
thought that he did not care whither or what, laughed
again; and more than once looked at Mr. Puddlebox,
blowing and puffing in exhaustion beside him, and
scarcely could control an impulse to push him off the
tail-board and laugh to see him clutch and expostulate
and fall; and once struck his fist against the revolving
wheel beside him and laughed aloud to feel the pain and
to see his bruised and dusty knuckles.
</p>

<p>
"Loony," said Mr. Puddlebox, catching the gleaming
eyes that were turned upon him in mischievous
thought to push him off, "Loony, you're getting
unspooked already."
</p>

<p>
"It's very jolly," said Mr. Wriford, and laughed.  "I
like this."
</p>

<p>
"You shall learn to like everything," said Mr. Puddlebox,
"and so to be jolly always."
</p>

<p>
"How do you live?" inquired Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Mr. Puddlebox, "by liking everything,
for that is the only way to live.  Sun, snow; rain, storm;
heat, cold; hunger, fullness; fatigue, rest; pain,
pleasure; I take all as they come and welcome each by turn
or all together.  They come from the Lord, boy, and
that is how I take them, love them, and return them to
the Lord again in form of praise.  Selah."
</p>

<p>
"Dash it," said Mr. Wriford, "you might be a
Salvationist, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Curse me," returned Mr. Puddlebox very cheerfully,
"I am nothing of the sort.  Would that I were.
I will tell you what I am, boy.  I am the most miserable
sinner that any man could be, and I am the most
miserable in this&mdash;that I know where mercy comes from,
which most poor sinners do not and therefore am less
miserable than I.  I have outraged my parents, and I
outrage heaven in every breath I draw, particularly
when, as, curse me, too often it is, my breath is
whisky-ladened: which thing is abominable to the nose of
godliness and very comfortable to my own.  I know
where mercy comes, loony, on the one hand because
I was trained for the ministry, and on the other because
I see it daily with my eyes.  I know where mercy comes,
yet I never can encompass it, for my flesh is ghastly
weak and ghastly vile and, curse me, I have worn it
thus so long that I prefer it so.  But if I cannot
encompass mercy, boy, I can return thanks for it; and if it
comes in form of scourge&mdash;cold, hunger, pain, they
are the three that fright me most&mdash;why, I deserve it
the more surely and return it in praise the more lustily.
That is how I live."
</p>

<p>
Many days hence it was to befall Mr. Wriford&mdash;in
very bitter lesson, in hour of deepest anguish&mdash;to
know a certain beauty in this odd testament of faith.
</p>

<p>
Just now, of his dizzy mood and of the teller's merry
eye as he told it, little more than its whimsicality
touched him; and when it was done, "Well, but that
doesn't feed you," he said.  "In that way&mdash;feeding
and clothing and the rest of it&mdash;how do you live in
that way?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, much in the same," returned Mr. Puddlebox.
"Taking what comes, and if need be, which it is my
constant prayer it need not, turning my hand to work,
of which there is plenty.  There is bread and raiment
in every house, some for asking, some for working, and
always some to get rid of me when I begin to work.
What there is not in every house, boy, is whisky, and it
is for that my brow has to sweat when, as now, my
bottle is empty.  But there are," continued Mr. Puddlebox,
beginning to wriggle in his seat and draw up his
legs with the evident intention of standing upon them,
"there are, happily, or, curse me, unhappily, other
ways of getting whisky; and the first is never to lose
an opportunity of looking for it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox's feet were now upon the tail-board
and he was clutching at the sacks, in great exertion to
stand upright.
</p>

<p>
"What now?" inquired Mr. Wriford, beginning to
laugh again.
</p>

<p>
"Why, to look for it," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "In
every new and likely place I always look for whisky.
If none, I sing very heartily 'O ye disappointments'
and am the better both for the praise and for the
fact there is none.  If some, I am both grateful
and, curse me, happy.  The top of these sacks is a
new place, my loony, and a very likely.  Our kind
coachman, as I observed, wore no coat and had no
bundle, nor were these beside him.  They are likely on
top."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come with you," said Mr. Wriford.  "It's a
devil of a climb."
</p>

<p>
"It's a devil of a prize," responded Mr. Puddlebox,
"if it's there."
</p>

<p>
It proved to be both the one and the other.  The
sacks, stacked in ridges, provided steps of a sort, but
each was of prodigious height, of very brief foothold,
and the sacks so tightly stuffed as to afford but a
scraping, digging hold for the fingers.  When to these
difficulties was added the swaying of the whole as the
wagon jolted along, there was caused on the part of the
climbers much panic clutching at each other, at the ropes
which bound the sacks, and at the sacks themselves,
together with much blowing and sounds of fear from
Mr. Puddlebox, vastly incommoded by his bulging
coattails, and much hysterical mirth from Mr. Wriford,
incommoded no little by laughter at the absurdity of
the escapade and at imagination of the grotesque
spectacle they must present as they swarmed.
</p>

<p>
He was first to reach the summit.  "By Jove, there's
a coat here, anyway!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox bulged up and plunged forward on
his face with a last convulsive scramble.  "And, by my
sins, a bottle!" cried Mr. Puddlebox, drawing the coat
aside.  "Beer, I fear me&mdash;a filling and unsatisfactory
drink."  He drew the cork and applied his nose.
"Whisky!" and applied his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" cried Mr. Wriford, astonished at a
thought that came to him with the length of
Mr. Puddlebox's drink.  "Man alive!  Do you drink it
neat?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hup!</i>  Curse me," said Mr. Puddlebox, "I do.  It
takes less room.  <i>Hup!</i>  This is the most infernal
torment, this hupping.  I must, but I never can, drink
more, <i>hup!</i> slowly.  As a rule," continued Mr. Puddlebox,
balancing on his knees and fumbling in his coattail
pockets, "as a rule I never rob a man of his bottle.
If a man has a bottle, he has an encouragement towards
thrift and sobriety.  It is a persuasion to put his whisky
there instead of at one draught into his mouth.  For
the moment I must suspend the by-law.  I cannot
decant this gentleman's whisky into my own bottle,
for our carriage shakes and would cause loss.  And I
cannot exchange for this bottle my own, for to mine I
am deeply attached.  Therefore&mdash;"  Mr. Puddlebox
fumbled the bottle into his pocket, appeared to find
some difficulty in accommodating it, produced it again
and took another drink from it and, as if this had indeed
diminished its bulk, this time slid it home, where
Mr. Wriford heard it clink a greeting with its empty fellow.
"Therefore," said Mr. Puddlebox&mdash;"<i>hup!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Well, mind they don't break," said Mr. Wriford.
"Let's have a look where we're getting to," and he
squirmed himself on elbows and knees towards the front
of the sacks and stretched out, face downwards.
</p>

<p>
"I never yet," said Mr. Puddlebox proudly, "committed
the crime of breaking a bottle."  From his knees
he took an observation down the road ahead of him,
announced: "We are getting towards the pretty hamlet
of Ditchenhanger," and coming forward lay full length
by Mr. Wriford's side.
</p>

<p>
This position brought their heads, overhanging the
sacks, immediately above the wagoner seated a long
arm's length below them, his horses walking, the reins
slack in his hands and himself, to all appearances, in
something of a doze.  A very large man, as Mr. Wriford
had previously noticed, with prodigious arms, bare to
the elbow; and at his unconsciousness of their presence,
hanging immediately above him, and at his sullen face
and the rage upon it if he knew, Mr. Wriford was
moved to silent squirms of laughter, and turned a
laughing face to Mr. Puddlebox's, suspended over the sacks
beside him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hup!</i>" said Mr. Puddlebox with shattering violence.
</p>

<p>
The wagoner started not less violently, looked about
him with jerking, savage head, while Mr. Wriford held
his breath and dared not move, uttered an oath of
extraordinarily unsavoury character, grabbed at his
whip, and lashed with all the force of his arm at his
horses.
</p>

<p>
The nature of their response exercised a very obvious
result upon the wagon.  It suffered a jerk that caused
from Mr. Wriford a frantic clutch at the sacks and from
Mr. Puddlebox a double explosion that cost him (as he
afterwards narrated) very considerable pain.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Huppup!</i>" said Mr. Puddlebox.  "Blink!  Hup!"
and with this his pudding-bowl hat detached itself from
his head and dropped lightly into the wagoner's lap.
That gentleman immediately produced another oath,
compared with which his earlier effort was as a sweet
smelling rose at dewy morn, drew up his unfortunate
team even more violently than he had urged them
forward, with very loud bellows bounded to the road and,
whip in hand, completed a very rapid circuit of his
wagon, bawling the while a catalogue of astoundingly
blood-curdling intentions which he proposed to wreak
upon somebody before, as he phrased it, he had his
blinking hair cut.
</p>

<p>
His passengers, considerably alarmed at these
proceedings, withdrew to the exact centre of the sacks
and there reflected, each in the other's face, his own
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Now you've done it, you silly ass," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"It's not over yet," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "I'm
afraid this is going to be very rough."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0202"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT TO LIVER OF A WAGONER
</h3>

<p>
"You're up there, ain't yer?" demanded the
wagoner, arrived at the other side of the wagon and
bawling from the road.  "You're up there, aren't yer?
I've got you, my beauty!  I'll cut your liver out for yer
before I have my blinkin' hair cut!  I've got you, my
beauty!  You're up there, aren't yer?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox poked his head very timidly over the
side, looked down upon their questioner, and remarked
in a small thin voice: "Yes&mdash;hup!"  He then drew
back very hastily, for at sight of him the wagoner with
a very loud bellow rushed forward and smote upward
with his whip in a manner fully calculated, to the
minds of his passengers, to cut up a sack or lay open a
liver with equal precision.  "Come down off out of it!"
bellowed this passionate gentleman, flogging upward
with appalling whistle and thud of his lash.  "Come
down off out of it.  I'll cut your liver out, my beauty!
I'll cut your coat off your back, before I have my
blinkin' hair cut."
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that the angry lash fell safely short of its
aim, Mr. Puddlebox again protruded his head.
</p>

<p>
"Now are you coming down," demanded the flaming
wagoner, "or am I coming up for you?"
</p>

<p>
"I should like to explain&mdash;" began Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
"I'll explain you!" roared the wagoner.  "I'll
explain you, my beauty!  Are you coming down off out
of it?"
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do if I do come?" inquired
Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
The carter, in a voice whose violence seemed likely
to throttle him, announced as his intention that he
proposed to cut out Mr. Puddlebox's liver with his whip
and then, having extracted it, to dance upon it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't come," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "In
that case, I think I'll stay here," he said, and said it
with a nervous little giggle that shot out of the wagoner
an inarticulate bellow of fury and a half-dozen of terrific
blows towards Mr. Puddlebox's anxious face.
</p>

<p>
"Come down off out of it!" bellowed the carter.
"I'll cut your liver out before I have my blinkin' hair
cut, my beauty."
</p>

<p>
The same nervous giggle again escaped the unfortunate
beauty whose liver was thus passionately demanded.
"But your hair doesn't want cutting," said
Mr. Puddlebox, "really&mdash;<i>hup!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"You fool!" Mr. Wriford cried.  "You utter fool!"
and in dramatic illustration of Mr. Puddlebox's folly,
the wagon began to shake with the violence of the
wagoner's ascent of it, and there preceded the ascent,
increasing in horror as it approached, an eruption of
astoundingly distressing oaths mingled in the most
blood-curdling way with references to liver and other
organs which were to be subjected at one and the same
time to step-dances and to a ferocious orgy of surgical
and cannibalistic practices.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was frightened.  There went out of him
the reckless glee in mad adventure that had possessed
him on the wagon till now.  There returned to him,
dreadfully as if a hand within him were tugging at his
vitals, twirling in his brain, drumming in his heart, the
coward fear that well of old he knew.
</p>

<p>
"Down!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "Down behind,
loony! quick!" and began to scramble backwards.
</p>

<p>
There came to Mr. Wriford some odd experiences.
He looked at Mr. Puddlebox and saw in the little round
face where usually was merriment, alarm, white and
sickly.  Then saw Mr. Puddlebox's eyes search his own,
and waver, and then fill with some purpose.  Then was
pulled and pushed backward by Mr. Puddlebox.  Then
both were hanging, half over the sacks, half on top.
Then over the front of the wagon before them appeared
the wagoner's cap and a vast arm clutching the whip.
Then Mr. Puddlebox scrambled forward a yard, placing
himself between Mr. Wriford and the approaching
fury.  "Down you go, loony; he's not seen you.
Hide yourself, boy."  Then Mr. Puddlebox's elbow and
then his knee at Mr. Wriford's chest, and Mr. Wriford
was slithered down the sacks and fallen in the road.
</p>

<p>
Now from above, and before yet Mr. Wriford could
get to his feet, very quick things.  Baleful howl from
the flaming wagoner standing on his driver's seat and
towering there in omnipotent command of the wagon-top.
Appalling whistle-<i>wup</i> of the whip in his mighty
and ferocious hand.  Pitiful yelps from Mr. Puddlebox,
head and shoulders exposed, baggy stern, surmounted
by the bulging pockets, suspended above Mr. Wriford
in the road and wriggling this way and that as the whip
fell.  Baleful howl from the flaming wagoner and the
whistle-<i>wup!</i> at each loudest word of it: "Now, my
beauty, I've GOT yer!"
</p>

<p>
Pitiful yelp from Mr. Puddlebox: "Yowp!  Hup!"
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll CUT your liver out for yer."&mdash;"Yeep!
Hup!"
</p>

<p>
"Before I have my BLINKIN' 'air cut."&mdash;"Yowp!"
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll CUT your liver out, my
beauty."&mdash;"<i>Yowp!  Yeep!  Hup!</i>  Hell!"
</p>

<p>
Beneath the blows and the convulsive wrigglings they
caused, Mr. Puddlebox's stern slipped lower down the
sacks.  Mr. Wriford scrambled to his feet from where
he was fallen to the road.  He was utterly terrified.  He
turned to run.  He stopped, and a cry of new fear
escaped him.  Figure of Wriford stood there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford put a hand before his eyes and went a
few steps to the side of the wagon and stopped again,
irresolute.
</p>

<p>
There came from above again that bellow, again
whistle-<i>wup!</i> of the whip, again from Mr. Puddlebox
in agonized response: "Yowp!  Hup!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford cried aloud: "Oh, why doesn't he drop
down?"
</p>

<p>
It seemed to him that Figure of Wriford turned upon
him with flaming eyes and grinding teeth and for the
first time spoke to him: "Why, to give you time to
get away and hide&mdash;to save you, you filthy coward!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford cried: "Oh&mdash;oh!"
</p>

<p>
And at once a dramatic change of scene.  In one
sudden and tremendous bound the flaming wagoner
hurled himself from the seat to the road, rushed bawling
around his wagon on the opposite side from where
Mr. Wriford trembled, came full beneath the hanging stern
of Mr. Puddlebox, and discharged upon it a cut of his
whip that made pretty caresses of his former efforts.
"Now I've got you, my beauty!"
</p>

<p>
With a loud and exceeding bitter cry, the beauty
released his hold.  As thunders the mountain avalanche,
so thundered he.  As falls the stricken oak so,
avalanched, the flaming wagoner fell beneath him.
</p>

<p>
There was a very loud crash of breaking bottles, and
immediately upon the hot summer air a pungent reek
of whisky.  There were enormous convulsions of
Mr. Puddlebox and the wagoner entwined in one great
writhing double monster prone in the roadway, and from
them a tremendous cloud of dust.  There were thuds,
oaths, <i>yawps</i>, <i>yeeps</i>, bellows, and with them the pleasant
music of broken bottles jangling.  The double monster
came to its four knees and writhed there; very
laboriously&mdash;as if it were a rheumatic giant&mdash;writhed to
its four legs and there stood and writhed amain; divided
suddenly, and there was an appalling wallop from one
to the other, and Mr. Puddlebox went reeling, musically
jangling, and the flaming wagoner, carried round by
the wallop's impetus, came staggering sideways a pace
towards Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford put down his head and shut his eyes and
rushed at him.  Mr. Wriford, as he rushed, saw Figure
of Wriford disappear as if swallowed.  Mr. Wriford
caught his foot in the wheel, was discharged like a
butting ram at the backs of the flaming wagoner's knees,
clutched, wrenched, was down with the bawling wagoner
beating at his head, and then, clutching and struggling,
was overturned beneath him.  Mr. Wriford heard a
yell, first of warning, then of triumph, from Mr. Puddlebox:
"Keep out of it, loony!  Well done, boy!  Well
done!  Glumph him, boy!  Glumph him!"  There was
a terrible run and kick from Mr. Puddlebox, and a
terrible jerk and cry from the flaming wagoner, and in
the next moment Mr. Wriford was on his feet and taking
share, his eyes mostly shut, in a whirlwind, three-sided
battle that spun up the road and down the road and
across the road, and in which sometimes Mr. Wriford
hit Mr. Puddlebox, and sometimes Mr. Puddlebox hit
Mr. Wriford, and sometimes both hit the wagoner and
sometimes by him were hit&mdash;a whirlwind, three-sided
battle, in which, in short, by common intent of the three,
the thing to do was simply to <i>hit</i> and to roar.  Six arms
whirling enormous thumps; six legs lashing tremendous
kicks; the air and three bodies receiving them; one
mouth bawling curses of the very pit of obscenity;
another howling: "Glumph him, boy!  Glumph
him!"  Mr. Wriford's mouth laughing with fierce, exultant,
hysterical glee.
</p>

<p>
The sudden rush that had rid Mr. Wriford of Figure
of Wriford had returned him, and returned him with
recklessness a hundredfold, to the mood, reckless of
what happened to him, that had first embarked him
on the wagon.  And more than that.  Out of the clutch
of cowardice and lusting into the lust of action!  When
swinging his legs over the tail-board of the wagon, he had
but gleefully thought of how now he was free, of caring
nothing what happened to him, of gleefully throwing
himself into any mad adventure.  He had but thought of
it; now he was in it! in it! in it! and in it! became the
slogan of his fighting as he fought.  "In it!" and a blind
whirling wallop at the flaming wagoner's flaming face.
"In it!" and colliding heavily with one of Mr. Puddlebox's
glumphing rushes, and laughing aloud.  "In it!"
and spun staggering with a thump of one of the wagoner's
whirling sledge-hammers, and staggering but to come
with a fierce glee "In it!  In it!" once again.  Out of
the clutch of cowardice that had him a moment
before&mdash;cowardice bested for the first time in all these years
of its nightmare sovereignty: and at that thought "In
it! in it! in it!" with fierce and fiercer lust and fierce
and fiercer and fiercest exultation.  "In it!"  Ah!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This extraordinary battle&mdash;extraordinary for a
shrinking, gentlemanly, refined, well-dressed, comfortably
housed, afternoon-tea-drinking Londoner&mdash;raged,
if it had any order at all, about the towering person of
the liver-cutting wagoner, and now went bawling to its
end.
</p>

<p>
For this gentleman would no sooner get the liver of
one antagonist in his fiery clutches than the other would
come at him like a runaway horse and require attention
that resulted in the escape of the first.  And now a liver,
heavily embedded in the bulky waist of Mr. Puddlebox,
came at him head down with a force and with a fortune
of aim that not even a stouter man than the wagoner
could have withstood.
</p>

<p>
A very terrible buffet had just been inflicted upon
Mr. Puddlebox.  A sledge-hammer wallop from the wagoner
had caught him in the throat ("<i>Ooop!</i>") and remained
there, squeezing ("<i>Arrp!</i>").  The other hand had then
clawed him like a tiger's bite in close proximity to his
coveted liver ("<i>Arrp!  Ooop!</i>"); and the two hands
had finally hurled him ten feet away to end in a most
shattering fall ("UMP!").  This manoeuvre was carried
out by the flaming wagoner from the side of the ditch
to which repeated rushes had driven him, and now he
turned and directed a stupendous kick at Mr. Wriford,
who came fiercely on his left.  Mr. Wriford twisted; the
immense boot but scraped him.
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Puddlebox&mdash;the flaming wagoner on one
leg, vitally exposed.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, head down, eyes shut, arms stretched
behind him, hymned on to victory by the music of the
broken bottles in his coat-tails, bounding across the
road at the highest speed of which he was capable and
into the liver-cutting gentleman's own liver and wind
with stunning and irresistible force and rich clash of
jangling glass.
</p>

<p>
Prone into the ditch the liver-cutting gentleman and
there lay&mdash;advertising his presence only by those
distressing groans which are at once the symptom of a
winding and the only sound of which a winded is capable.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, also in the ditch, separated himself
from the stricken mass and, stepping upon it, emerged
upon the victorious battle-field rubbing his head.
</p>

<p>
A very loud, panting "Hurrah!" from Mr. Wriford;
but before further felicitations could be exchanged,
attention was demanded by a fourth party to the scene,
who had been approaching unobserved for some time,
and who now arrived and announced himself with:
"Now then&mdash;hur!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
DISTURBED EQUIPOISE OF A COUNTERBALANCING MACHINE
</h3>

<p>
This was a sergeant of police, short, red, hot, neckless,
filled with a seeming excess of bile, or of self-importance,
which he must needs correct or affirm&mdash;according as
it was the one or the other&mdash;with a <i>hur!</i> at the end of
each sentence, and balanced by prodigious development
in the rear against the remarkable fullness beneath his
tunic in the front, which he carried rather as though it
were a drum or some other detachable article that must
be conducted with care.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was a little tickled at this gentleman's
appearance and, of the reckless mood that had
him&mdash;panting, flaming, bruised, exulting&mdash;was not at all
inclined to be hectored in the way that the <i>hur!</i> seemed
to suggest was the sergeant's custom.  Trained, however,
to the Londoner's proper respect for a policeman, he
answered, still panting: "There's been a bit of a fight."
</p>

<p>
"Saw that&mdash;hur!" said the sergeant.  "Three of
you when I come along.  Where's the other&mdash;hur!"
</p>

<p>
"In the ditch," said Mr. Wriford.  "Can't you hear
him?"
</p>

<p>
The sergeant carried his drum carefully to the sound
of the winded groans and, lowering it so far as he was
able, peered over its circumference at the prostrate
wagoner.  In this position his posterior development,
called upon to exercise its counterbalancing effect in the
highest degree, displayed itself to immense advantage,
and Mr. Wriford eyed it with a twitching of his face
that spoke of a sudden freakish thought.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant readjusted his drum and turned upon
him: "Who's done this?  Hur!"
</p>

<p>
"Been a fight, I tell you," said Mr. Wriford, and
laughed at the idea that had been in his mind and at the
look it would have caused on the sergeant's face if he
had executed it.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant drew in a breath that raised the drum
in a motion that spelt rufflement.  "Don't want you to
tell me nothing but what you're asked," he said.  "Man
lying here hurt.  Case of assault&mdash;hur!"  He moved
the drum slowly in the direction of Mr. Puddlebox and
this time "hured" before he spoke.  "Hur!  Thought
I knew you as I come along.  Seen you afore&mdash;in the
dock,&mdash;ain't I?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been in so many," said Mr. Puddlebox amicably,
wiping his face from which the sweat streamed,
"that if I've omitted yours, you must put it down to
oversight, not unfriendliness."
</p>

<p>
"None o' that!" returned the sergeant.  "No sauce.
I know yer.  Charged with assault, both of yer, an'
anything said used evidence against yer.  Hur!  Who's
this man down here?"
</p>

<p>
"Look and see if you know him," Mr. Wriford
suggested.  "I don't."
</p>

<p>
The drum was again advanced to the ditch, and the
counterbalancing operation again very carefully put
into process.  Mr. Wriford's eyes danced with the wild
idea that possessed him.  To cap this tremendous
hullabaloo in which he had been in it! in it! in it!  To fly
the wildest flight of all!  To overturn, with a walloping
kick, a policeman!
</p>

<p>
He drew near to Mr. Puddlebox and pulled his sleeve
to attract his attention.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's George!" said the sergeant, midway
in operation of his counterbalancing machine.  "That's
old George Huggs&mdash;hur!"
</p>

<p>
"Can't be!" said Mr. Wriford and pulled Mr. Puddlebox's
sleeve, and pointed first at the tremendous uniformed
stern gingerly lowering the tunic-ed drum, then
at his own foot, then down the road.
</p>

<p>
"Can't be!" returned the sergeant.  "What yer
mean, can't be!  That's Miller Derrybill's George Huggs.
George!  George, you've got to come out and prosecute.
George, I say&mdash;hur!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, realizing the meaning of Mr. Wriford's
pantomime, puffed out his cheeks with laughter
bursting to be free and nodded.  Mr. Wriford took one
quick step and poised his foot at the tremendous target.
</p>

<p>
"George!" said the sergeant.  "George Huggs!  Hur!"
</p>

<p>
"Whoop!" said Mr. Wriford, and lashed.
</p>

<p>
The counterbalancing machine, not specified for this
manner of usage, overturned with the slow and awful
movement of a somersaulting elephant.  One agonized
scream from its owner, one dreadful bellow from George
Huggs as the enormous sergeant plunged head foremost
upon him&mdash;Mr. Wriford and Mr. Puddlebox, shouts
of laughter handicapping their progress but impossible
of control, at full speed down the road.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0204"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
FIRST PERSON SINGULAR
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Close of this day found the two in the outlying barn
of a farm to which, as night fell, Mr. Puddlebox had led
the way.  There had intervened between it and the
glorious battle-field an imperial midday banquet at an
inn provided by Mr. Wriford, who found sixteen
shillings in his pocket and had expended upon the meal
four, upon sundries for further repasts one, and upon
a bottle of whisky to replace the music in Mr. Puddlebox's
coat-tail three and six.  Thence a long amble to
put much countryside between themselves and the
mighty gentlemen left in the ditch, and so luxuriously
to bed upon delicious hay, three parts of the whisky in
the bottle, the other quarter comfortably packed into
Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
Through the banquet and through the day there had
been bursts of laughter, started by one and immediately
chorused by the other, at recollections of the stupendous
struggle and the stupendous kick; also, prompted by
Mr. Wriford, reiterated conversation upon a particular
aspect of the affair.
</p>

<p>
"I did my share?" Mr. Wriford would eagerly inquire.
</p>

<p>
"Loony, you did two men's share," Mr. Puddlebox
would reply.  "And your kick of the policeman was
another two men's&mdash;four men's share, boy.  I didn't
want you in it, loony.  You're not fit for such, I thought.
But you glumphed 'em, boy!  You glumphed 'em like
six men!  Loony, you're unspooking&mdash;you're unspooking
double quick!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford thrilled at that and laughed aloud and
swung his arms in glee, and through the advancing night,
lying warmly in the hay by Mr. Puddlebox's side,
continued to feast upon it and to chuckle over it; and
while he feasted and chuckled very often said to
himself: "And that's the way to get rid of myself following
me.  When I was frightened by the wagon, he came.
When I was walloping and smashing, he went and
hasn't come back.  Very well.  Now I know."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford enjoyed some hours of dreamless sleep.
He awoke, and on the hay and in the darkness lay awake
and thought.
</p>

<p>
"Well, this is a very funny state of affairs," Mr. Wriford
thought.  "Except that I'm in a barn and shall
get locked up for a tramp if I'm caught, or at least into
a devil of a row with the farmer if he catches me, I'm
dashed if I know where I am.  I've stolen a ride on a
wagon, and I've had a most extraordinary fight in the
road with the chap who was driving it.  My eyes were
shut half the time.  I wonder I wasn't killed.  I must
have got some fearful smashes.  I suppose I didn't feel
them&mdash;you don't when your blood's up.  I belted him
a few stiff 'uns, though; by gad, I did!  I don't know
how I had the pluck.  I wonder what's the matter with
me&mdash;I mean to say, me! fighting a chap like that.
And then I kicked a policeman.  Good Lord, you
know&mdash;that's about the most appalling thing a man
can do!  Kicked him bang over&mdash;heels over head!  By
gad, he did go a buster, though!"  And at recollection
of the buster that the police sergeant went, Mr. Wriford
began to laugh and laughed quietly for a good while.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to think again.  "I chucked myself
into the river," Mr. Wriford thought.  "I'd forgotten
that.  I've not thought about it since I did it.  Good
Lord, that was a thing to do!  I didn't mean to.  One
moment I was walking along the Embankment, and the
next I was falling in.  I wonder what I did in between&mdash;how
I got up, how I got in.  I wanted to die.  Yes, I
tried to drown and die.  I suppose I'm not dead?  No,
I can't possibly be dead.  Everything's funny enough to
be another world, but I take my oath I'm not dead.
This chap Puddlebox&mdash;which can't possibly be his real
name&mdash;thinks I'm mad.  But I'm absolutely not mad.
I may be dead&mdash;I know I'm not, though; at least I'm
pretty sure I'm not&mdash;but I'm dashed if I'm mad.  I've
been too near madness&mdash;God knows&mdash;not to know it
when I see it.  Those sort of rushes-up in my head&mdash;I
might have gone mad any time with one of those.  Well,
they're gone.  I'll never have another; I feel absolutely
sure of that.  My head feels empty&mdash;feels as though
it was a different part of me, like I've known my foot
feel when it's gone to sleep and I can touch it without
feeling it.  Before, my head used to feel full, cram full.
That's the only difference and that's not mad: it's just
the reverse, if anything.  What about seeing myself?
Who am I then?  I mean to say, am I the one I can see
or the one I think I am?  Well, the thing is, is there any
one there when I see him or is it only imagination, only
a delusion?  If it's a delusion, then it's madness and I'm
mad.  Well, the very fact that I know that, proves it
isn't a delusion and proves I'm absolutely sane; the
very fact that I can lie here and argue about it and that
I can't see it now because it isn't here, and can see it
sometimes because it is there&mdash;that very fact proves
I'm not mad.  I think I know what it is.  It's the same
sort of thing as I remember once or twice years ago,
when I first came to London and had a night out with
some men and got a bit tipsy.  I remember then sort
of seeing myself&mdash;sort of trying to pull myself together
and realise who I really was; and while I was trying, I
could see myself playing the fool and staggering about
and making an ass of myself.  It was the drink that
did that&mdash;that kind of separated me into two.  Now
I've done the same thing by trying to drown myself
and nearly succeeding and by coming into this extraordinary
state of affairs after living in a groove so long.
Part of me is still in that old life and gets the upper hand
of me sometimes, just as the drink used to.  I've only
got to realise that I've done with all that, and I've only
got to smash about and not care what happens to me,
and I'm all right.
</p>

<p>
"And I have done with it," cried Mr. Wriford aloud
and fiercely, and sitting up and continuing to speak very
quickly.  "I have done with it!  All these years I've
been shut up and never enjoyed myself like other men.
I've given up my life to others and got mixed up in their
troubles and never been able to live for myself.  Now
I'm going to begin life all over again.  I'm not going to
care for anybody.  I'm just going to let myself&mdash;go!
I'm not going to care what happens.  I'm not going to
think of other people's feelings.  I'm not going to be
polite or care a damn what anybody thinks.  If I get
hurt, I'm just going to be hurt and not care.  If I want
to do what would have seemed wrong in the old days,
I'm just going to do it and not care.  I've cared too
much! that's what's been wrong with me.  Now I'm
not going to care for anything or anybody.  This chap
Puddlebox said that what was wrong with me was that
I thought too much about myself.  I remember Brida
telling me the same thing once.  That's just exactly
what it's not.  All my life I've thought too much about
other people.  That's been the trouble.  Done!  Whoop,
my boy, it's done!  There's not going to be anybody in
the world for myself except me&mdash;yes, and not even me.
I'm going to be outside it all and just look on&mdash;and this
me lying here can do what it likes, anything it likes.
Hurt itself, starve itself, chuck itself down&mdash;that's
one of the things I want to do: to get up somewhere
and chuck myself down <i>smash!</i> and see what happens
and laugh at it, whatever it is.  I'm simply not going
to care.  I belong to myself&mdash;or rather myself belongs
to me, and I'm going to do what I like with it&mdash;just
exactly what I like.  Puddlebox!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford turned to the recumbent form beside
him to nudge it into wakefulness, but found it already
awake.  The gleam of Mr. Puddlebox's open eyes was
to be seen in the darkness, and Mr. Puddlebox said:
"Loony, how many of you are here this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"There's only me," said Mr. Wriford.  "I'm not
going to care&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're spooked again, loony," Mr. Puddlebox
interrupted him.  "I've been listening to you talking."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can listen to this," said Mr. Wriford.
"I'm not going to care a damn what happens to me or
care a hang for anybody&mdash;you or anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "That's settled."
</p>

<p>
"So it is," said Mr. Wriford, "and I tell you what
I'm going to do first."
</p>

<p>
Sufficient of morning was by now stealing through
cracks and crevices of the barn to radiate its gloom.
Two great doors admitted to the interior.  Between
them ran a gangway of bricked floor with hay stacked
upwards to the roof on either hand.  Mr. Wriford could
almost touch the roof where now he stood up, his feet
sinking in the hay, and could see the top of the ladder
by which overnight they had climbed to their bed.
"What I'm going to do first," said Mr. Wriford,
pointing to the gangway beneath them, "is to jump down
there and see what happens."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll tell you what you are going to do last,"
returned Mr. Puddlebox, "and that also is jump down
there, because you'll break your neck and that'll be
the end of you, boy."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to see," said Mr. Wriford.  "Smash!
That's just what I want to see."
</p>

<p>
"Half a minute," said Mr. Puddlebox and caught
Mr. Wriford's coat.  "Just a moment, my loony, for
there's some one else wants to see also.  There's some
one coming in."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
INTENTIONS, IN HIS NIGHTSHIRT, OF A FARMER
</h3>

<p>
It was symptomatic of Mr. Wriford's state in these
days that any interruption at once diverted him from
his immediate purpose and turned him eagerly to
whatever new excitement offered.  So now, and here was an
excitement that promised richly.  Perched up there in
the darkness and with the guilty knowledge of being a
trespasser, it was a very tingling thing to hear the
sounds to which Mr. Puddlebox had called attention
and, peering towards the door from which they came, to
speculate into what alarms they should develop.  This
was speedily discovered.  The sounds proceeded from
the door opposite to that by which entry had been made
overnight, and from fumbling passed into a jingling
of keys, a turning of the lock, and so gave admittance
to a gleam of yellow light that immediately was
followed by a man bearing a lantern swinging from his left
hand and in his right a bunch of keys.
</p>

<p>
This was a curious gentleman who now performed
curious actions.  First he peered about him, holding
the lantern aloft, and this disclosed him to be short
and very ugly, having beneath a black growth on his
upper lip yellow teeth that protruded and came down
upon his lower.  This gentleman was hatless and in a
shirt without collar lumped so bulgingly into the top
of his trousers as to present the idea that it was very
long.  Indeed, as he turned about, the lantern at arm's
length above his head, it became clear to those who
watched that this was his nightshirt that he wore.  Next
he set down the lantern, locked the door by which he
had entered, placed across it an iron bar which fell into
a bracket on either side, took up his light again, and
proceeded along the gangway.
</p>

<p>
All this he did very stealthily&mdash;turning the key so
that the lock could scarcely be heard as it responded,
fitting his iron bar, first with great attention on the one
side and then on the other, and then walking forward
on his toes with manifest straining after secrecy.  A rat
scurried in the straw behind him, and he twisted round
towards it as though terribly startled, with a quick hiss
of his breath and with his hand that held the keys
clapped swiftly to his heart.
</p>

<p>
Now he came beneath the stack upon which our two
trespassers watched and wondered, and there remained
for a space lost from view.  There was to be heard a
clinking as though he operated with his lantern, and
with it a shuffling as though he disturbed the straw.
Next he suddenly went very swiftly to the further door,
passed through it in haste, and could be heard locking
it from the outside, then wrenching at the key as though
in a great hurry to be gone, then gone.
</p>

<p>
"That's funny," said Mr. Wriford.  "Was he looking
for something?"
</p>

<p>
"He was precious secret about it," said Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it," cried Mr. Wriford, "he's left his lamp
behind.  You can see the gleam."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox, like curious hound that investigates
the breeze, sat with chin up and with twitching nose;
then sprang to his feet.  "Curse it," cried Mr. Puddlebox,
"he's set the place afire!  Skip, loony, skip, or
we're trapped!" and Mr. Puddlebox hurled himself
towards the ladder, reversed himself upon it, missed a
rung in his haste, and with a very loud cry disappeared
with great swiftness, and with a very loud bump crashed
with great force to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford followed.  Mr. Wriford, with no very
clear comprehension of what was toward, but very
eager, also slipped, also slithered, and also crashed.
</p>

<p>
"Hell!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "Blink!  Get <i>off</i> me,
loony!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was raised and rolled as by convulsion
of a mountain beneath him.  As he rolled, he had a
glimpse of the lantern embedded in a nest of straw, its
smoky flame naked of chimney, and from the flame
towards the straw a strip of cloth with a little red
smoulder midway upon it.  As he sat up, the smoulder flared
to a little puff of flame, ran swiftly down the cloth,
flared again in the straw, then was eclipsed beneath the
mighty Puddlebox, bounded forward from hands and
knees upon it.
</p>

<p>
"The lamp, boy!" bellowed Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford dashed at the lamp, bestowed upon it
all the breath he could summon, and flattened himself
beside Mr. Puddlebox upon a spread of flame that, as he
blew, ran from lantern to straw.
</p>

<p>
"Good boy!" said Mr. Puddlebox.  "That was
quick," and himself at once did something quicker.
Very cautiously first he raised his body upon his hands
and knees, squinted beneath it, then dropped it again
with immense swiftness and wriggled it violently into
the straw.  "I'm still burning down here," cried
Mr. Puddlebox, and turned a face of much woe and concern
towards Mr. Wriford, and inquired: "How's yours,
loony?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford went through the first, or cautious,
portion of Mr. Puddlebox's performance and announced:
"Mine's out.  Get up and let's have a look."
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Mr. Puddlebox irritably, "how to the
devil can I get up?  If I get up it will burst out, and if
I lie here I shall be slowly roasted alive.  This is the
most devil of a predicament that ever a man was in,
and I will challenge any man to be in a worse.  <i>Unch</i>&mdash;my
stomach is already like a pot on the fire.  Ooch!
Blink."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the fire's simply gaining while you lie there,"
cried Mr. Wriford.  "I can smell it.  It's simply
gaining, you ass."
</p>

<p>
"Ass!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "Ass!  I tell you it
is you will look an ass and a roast ass if I move.  I can
get no weight on it to crush it like this.  Unch!  What
I am going to do is to turn over and press it down,
moreover I can bear roasting better on that other side
of me.  Now be ready to give me a hand if the flames
burst, and be ready to run, loony&mdash;up the ladder and
try the roof."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox then raised his chest upon his arms,
made a face of great agony as the released pressure
caused his stomach to feel the heat more fiercely, then
with a stupendous convulsion hurled himself about and
gave first a very loud cry as the new quarter of his
person took the fire and then many wriggles and a
succession of groans as with great courage he pressed his seat
down upon the smouldering embers.  Lower he wriggled,
still groaning.  "Ah," groaned Mr. Puddlebox.  "Arp.
Ooop.  Erp.  Blink.  Eep.  Erps.  Ooop.  Hell!"  He
then felt about him with his hands, and with the fingers
of one finding what he sought and finding it
uncommonly hot, brought his fingers to his mouth with a
bitter yelp; fumbled again most cautiously, wriggled
yet more determinedly, groaned anew, yet at longer
intervals, and presently, a beaming smile overspreading
his countenance, raised an arm aloft and announced
triumphantly: "Out!"
</p>

<p>
"Out!" repeated Mr. Puddlebox, rising and beating
smoulder from his waistcoat with one hand and from
his trousers with the other.
</p>

<p>
"You were devilish plucky," said Mr. Wriford.  "I
can't help laughing now it's over, you know.  But it
was a narrow squeak.  You were quick getting down,
and you saved both our lives by hanging on like
that."
</p>

<p>
"Why, you were quick, too, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox.
"You were quick after me as a flash&mdash;and
plucky.  I'd not have done it alone.  You're coming on,
boy; you're coming on.  You're unspooking every
minute."
</p>

<p>
"I did nothing," said Mr. Wriford.  But he was
secretly glad at the praise, and this, joined to his earlier
determination to care nothing for anybody nor for what
happened to him, spurred him to give eager aid to what
Mr. Puddlebox now proposed.
</p>

<p>
"I am parboiled in front," said Mr. Puddlebox,
finishing his beating of himself, "and I am underdone
behind; but the fire is out, and now it is for us to get
out.  Loony, that was a damned, cold-blooded villain
that came here to burn us, and a damned ugly villain
as ever I saw, and I will challenge any man to show me
an uglier.  There is a lesson to be taught him, my loony,
and there is compensation to be paid by him; and this
he shall be taught and shall pay before I am an hour
older in sin."
</p>

<p>
With this Mr. Puddlebox marched very determinedly
up the ladder which he had descended very abruptly,
and preceded Mr. Wriford across the top of the hay
to the point where this was nearest met by the sloping
roof.  "It's all very fine," doubted Mr. Wriford,
addressing the determined back as they made their way,
"it's all very fine, Puddlebox, but mind you we look
like getting ourselves in a devil of a fix if we go messing
round this chap, whoever he is.  He's probably the
farmer.  If he is it looks as if he wanted to fire his barn
to get the insurance; and it'll be an easy thing for him,
and a jolly good thing, to shove the blame on us.  That's
what I think."
</p>

<p>
"Loony," returned Mr. Puddlebox, arrived under
the roof and facing him, "you think too much, and
that's just what's the matter with you, as I've told you
before.  To begin with, his barn has not been burnt,
and that's just where we've got him.  We are heroes,
my loony, and I am a burnt hero, and some one's got to
pay for it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's reply to this was first a look of sharp
despair upon his face and then to raise his fists and
drum them fiercely upon his head.
</p>

<p>
"Why, boy! boy!" cried Mr. Puddlebox and caught
Mr. Wriford's hands and held them.  "Why, what to
the devil is that for?"
</p>

<p>
"That's for what I was doing!" cried Mr. Wriford.
"That's because I stopped to think.  I'm never going
to think any more, and I'm never going to stop any
more.  And if I catch myself stopping or thinking I
shall kill myself if need be!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, why to the devil," said Mr. Puddlebox very
quickly, "do you stop to beat yourself instead of doing
what I tell you?  Where there's a little hole, my loony,
there's easy work to make a big one.  Here's plenty of
little holes in these old tiles of this roof.  Up on my
shoulders, loony, and get to work on them."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0206"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
RISE AND FALL OF INTEREST IN A FARMER
</h3>

<p>
Symptomatic again of Mr. Wriford's condition that
his storm was gone as quickly as it came.  Now filled
him only the adventure of breaking out; and he was no
sooner, with much laughter, straddled upon Mr. Puddlebox's
shoulders and pulling at the tiles, than with
smallest effort the little holes in the weather-worn
roofing became the large one that Mr. Puddlebox had
promised.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa!" cried Mr. Puddlebox, plunging in the
yielding hay beneath Mr. Wriford's weight.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa!" echoed Mr. Wriford, and to check the
staggering grabbed at the crumbling tiles.
</p>

<p>
"Blink!" cried Mr. Puddlebox and collapsed.
"Curse me, is the roof come in on us?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford extricated himself and stood away,
rubbing his head that had received tiles like discharge
of thunderbolts.  "A pretty good chunk of it has,"
said Mr. Wriford.  "There's your hole right enough."
</p>

<p>
This was indeed a great rent capable of accommodating
their purpose and more; and Mr. Puddlebox,
whose head also needed rubbing, now arose and examined
it with his customary cheerfulness.  "That's a
fine hole, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox, "and a clever one
also, for here to this side of it runs a beam which, if it
will support us, will have us out, and if it will not, will
fetch the whole roof down and have us out that way.
Jump for the beam, boy, while I lift you."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox's hands on either side of Mr. Wriford's
hips, jumping him, and then at his legs, shoving him,
enabled Mr. Wriford with small exertion soon to be
straddled along the roof, and then with very enormous
exertion to engage in the prodigious task of dragging
Mr. Puddlebox after him.  When this was accomplished
so far as that Mr. Puddlebox's arms, head and
chest were upon the beam and the remainder of his
body suspended from it, "It's devilish steep up here,"
grunted Mr. Wriford, flat on his face, hauling amain on
the slack of Mr. Puddlebox's trousers, and not at all at
his strongest by reason of much laughter at Mr. Puddlebox's
groans and strainings; "it's devilish steep and
nothing to hold on to.  Look out how you come or
you'll have us both over and break our necks."
</p>

<p>
"Well, when to the devil shall I come?" groaned
Mr. Puddlebox.  "This is the very devil of a pain to
have my stomach in; and I challenge any man to have
his stomach in a worse.  I must drop down again or I
am like to be cut in halves."
</p>

<p>
"I'll never get you up again if you do," Mr. Wriford
told him.  "I've got your trousers tight to heave you
if you'll swing.  Swing your legs sideways, and when I
say 'Three' swing them up on the beam as high as you
can."
</p>

<p>
The counting of One and Two set Mr. Puddlebox's
legs, aided by Mr. Wriford's hands on his stern, swinging
like a vast pendulum.  "Hard as you can as you
come back," called Mr. Wriford, "and hang on like
death when you're up&mdash;THREE!"
</p>

<p>
With a most tremendous swing the boots of the
pendulum reached the roof and clawed a foothold.  Between
heels and one shoulder its powerful stern depended
ponderously above the hay.  "Heave yourself!" shouted
Mr. Wriford, hauling on the trousers.  "Roll yourself!
Heave yourself!"  Mr. Puddlebox heaved enormously,
rolled tremendously, and, like the counterbalancing
machine of the police sergeant, up came his stern, and
prodigiously over.
</p>

<p>
"Look out!" cried Mr. Wriford.  "Look out!  Let
go, you ass!"
</p>

<p>
"Blink!" cried Mr. Puddlebox, flat and rolling on
the steep pitch of the roof.  "Blink!  We're killed!"
clutched anew at Mr. Wriford, tore him from his moorings,
and, knotted with him in panic-stricken embrace,
whirled away to take the plunge and then the drop.
</p>

<p>
The strawyard in which the barn stood was fortunately
well bedded in straw about the walls of the building.
When, with tremendous thump, with the familiar
sound of smashing glass and familiar scent of whisky
upon the morning air, the two had come to rest and had
discovered themselves unbroken&mdash;"Why the dickens
didn't you let go of me?" Mr. Wriford demanded.  "I
could have hung on with one hand and held you."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox sat up with his jolly smile and glancing
at the height of their descent gave with much fervour:
</p>

<p>
"O ye falls of the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise
Him and magnify Him for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford jumped up and waved his arms and
laughed aloud and then cried: "That was all right.
Now I'm not caring!  Now I'm living!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, look you, my loony," said Mr. Puddlebox,
beaming upon him with immense delight, "look you,
that was very much all right; and that is why I return
praise for it.  We might have been killed in falling from
there, but most certainly we are not killed; and if we
had not fallen we should still be up there, and how I
should have found heart to make such a devil of a leap
I am not at all aware.  Here we are down and nothing
the worse save for this disaster that, curse me, my
whisky is gone again.  Thus there is cause for praise
in everything, as I have told you, and in this fall such
mighty good cause as I shall challenge you or any man
to look at that roof and deny.  Now," continued
Mr. Puddlebox, getting to his feet, "do you beat your head
again, boy, or do we proceed to the farmhouse?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said seriously, "No, I'm damned if I beat
my head now, because that time I didn't stop and
didn't think except just for a second when we were
falling, and then I couldn't stop even if I'd wanted to.
No, I'm damned if I beat my head this time."
</p>

<p>
"What it is," said Mr. Puddlebox, emptying his
tail-pocket of the broken whisky bottle, and proceeding
with Mr. Wriford towards the farmhouse, "what it
is, is that you are damned if you do beat your head&mdash;that
is, you are spooked, loony, which is the same thing."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford paid no apparent attention to this, but
his glee at believing that, as he had said, he now was not
caring and now was living, gave an excited fierceness
to his share in their immediate behaviour, which now
became very extraordinary.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0207"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
PROFOUND ATTACHMENT TO HIS FARM OF A FARMER
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The front door of the farmhouse, embowered in a
porch, was found to be on the side further from the
strawyard.  A fine knocker, very massive, hung upon
the door, and this Mr. Puddlebox now seized and
operated very loudly, with effect of noise which, echoing
through the silent house and through the still air of
early morning, would in former circumstances have
utterly horrified Mr. Wriford and have put him to
panic-stricken flight in very natural apprehension of
what it would bring forth.  Now, however, it had no
other effect upon him than first to make him give a
nervous gasp and nervous laugh of nervous glee, and
next himself to seize the knocker and put into it all
the determination of those old days forever ended and
these new days of freedom in which he cared for nothing
and for nobody now begun.
</p>

<p>
Fiercely Mr. Wriford knocked until his arm was tired
and then flung down the knocker with a last crash and
turned on Mr. Puddlebox a flushed face and eyes that
gleamed.  "I don't care a damn what happens!" he
cried.
</p>

<p>
"My word," said Mr. Puddlebox, gazing at him,
"something is like to happen now after all that din.
You've got hold of yourself this time, boy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford laughed recklessly.  "I'll show you,"
he cried, "I'll show you this time!" and took up the
knocker again.
</p>

<p>
But something was shown without his further effort.
His hand was scarcely put to the knocker, when a
casement window grated above the porch in which they
stood, and a very harsh voice cried: "What's up?
Who's that?  What's the matter there?" and then
with a change of tone: "What's that light in the sky?
Is there a fire?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, his new fierceness of not caring, of
letting himself go, fierce upon him, was for rushing out
of the porch to look up at the window and face this
inquiry, but Mr. Puddlebox a moment restrained him.
"That's our old villain for sure," Mr. Puddlebox
whispered.  "There's no ghost of light in the sky that fire
would make; but he's prepared for one, and that proves
him the old villain that he is."
</p>

<p>
"Now, then!" rasped the voice.  "Who are you
down there?  What's up?  What's that light in the
sky?"
</p>

<p>
Out from the porch charged Mr. Wriford, Mr. Puddlebox
with a hand on his arm bidding him: "Go warily,
boy; leave this to me."
</p>

<p>
So they faced the window, and there, sure enough,
framed within it, was displayed the gentleman that had
been seen with the lantern, with the black scrub upon
his upper lip, and with the yellow teeth protruded
beneath it.
</p>

<p>
"That light is the moon," Mr. Puddlebox informed
him pleasantly.  "Luna, the dear old moon.
Queen-Empress of the skies."
</p>

<p>
"The moon!" shouted the yellow-toothed gentleman.
"The moon!  Who the devil are you, and what's your
business?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox responded stoutly to this rough address.
"Why, what to the devil else should it be but
the moon?  Is it something else you're looking for&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
The yellow-toothed gentleman interrupted him by
leaning out to his waist from the window and bellowing:
"Something else!  Come, what the devil's up and
what's your business, or I'll rouse the house and set
about the pair of 'ee."
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Wriford, no longer to be restrained.  Mr. Wriford,
fierce to indulge his resolution not to care for
anybody and shaking with the excitement of it.
Mr. Wriford, to Mr. Puddlebox's much astonishment, in
huge and ferocious bawl: "What's up!" bawled Mr. Wriford,
hopping about in reckless ecstasy of fierceness.
"What's up!  Why, you know jolly well what's up,
you beastly old villain.  Tried to set your barn afire,
you ugly-faced old scoundrel!  I saw you!  I was in
there!  I saw you with your lamp!  Come down, you
rotten-toothed old fiend!  Come down and have your
face smashed, you miserable old sinner!"
</p>

<p>
The gentleman thus opprobriously addressed disappeared
with great swiftness, and immediately could be
heard thumping down-stairs with sounds that betokened
bare feet.
</p>

<p>
"That's done it," said Mr. Wriford, wiping his face
which was very hot, and placed himself before the
porch to await the expected arrival.
</p>

<p>
"My goodness, it has," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "You've
let yourself go this time, boy.  And what the devil is
going to happen next&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I'll show you," cried Mr. Wriford and, as the key
turned in the lock and the door opened, proceeded to
the demonstration thus promised with a fierceness of
action even more astonishing than his earlier outburst
of words.
</p>

<p>
The door was no sooner opened to reveal the yellow-toothed
gentleman in his nightshirt and bare feet, than
Mr. Wriford rushed upon him, seized him by his flowing
garment, and dragged him forth into the yard.
Mr. Wriford then revolved very swiftly, causing the
yellow-toothed gentleman, who had the wider ambit to perform,
to revolve more swiftly yet, and this on naked feet that
made him complain very loudly and bound very highly
when they lighted upon a stone, spun him in these
dizzy circles down the yard, and after a final maze at
final speed released him with the result that the
yellow-toothed gentleman first performed a giddy whirl entirely
on his own account, then the half of another on his
heels and in mortal danger of overbalancing, and then,
with the best intentions in the world to complete this
circuit, was checked by waltzing into his duck-pond,
wherein with a very loud shriek he disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford again wiped his face, which was now
much hotter than before, and with a cry of "Come on!"
to Mr. Puddlebox, who was staring in amazement
towards the pond and its struggling occupant, made a
run to the house.  Mr. Puddlebox joined him within
the door, and Mr. Wriford then locked the door behind
them, and looking very elatedly at Mr. Puddlebox,
inquired of him triumphantly: "Well, what about
that?"
</p>

<p>
"Loony," said Mr. Puddlebox, "I never saw the like
of it.  It's a licker."
</p>

<p>
"So it is!" cried Mr. Wriford.  "I fairly buzzed
him, didn't I?  You needn't whisper.  There's no one
here but ourselves, I'm pretty sure.  I'm pretty sure
that chap's managed to get the place to himself so that
he could make no mistake about getting his barn burnt
down.  Anyway, I'm going to see, and I don't care a
dash if there is."  And by way of seeing, Mr. Wriford
put up his head and shouted: "Hulloa!  Hulloa, is
there anybody in here?"
</p>

<p>
"Hulloa!" echoed Mr. Puddlebox, subscribing with
great glee to Mr. Wriford's excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Hulloa!" cried Mr. Wriford in a very loud voice.
"If anybody wants a hit in the eye come along down
and ask for it!"
</p>

<p>
To this engaging invitation there was from within
the house no answer; but from without, against the
door, a very loud thud which was the yellow-toothed
gentleman hurling himself against it, and then his fists
beating against it and his voice crying: "Let me in!
Let me in, won't you!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't!" called Mr. Wriford, and answered
the banging with lusty and defiant kicks.  "Get back
to your pond or I'll come and throw you there."
</p>

<p>
"I'm cold," cried the yellow-toothed gentleman,
changing his voice to one of entreaty.  "Look here, I
want to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
"Go and light your barn again and warm yourself,"
shouted Mr. Puddlebox; but the laughter with which
he shouted it was suddenly checked, for the
yellow-toothed gentleman was heard to call: "Hullo!  Hi!
Jo!  Quick, Jo!  Come along quick!"
</p>

<p>
"Boy," said Mr. Puddlebox, "we ought to have got
away from this while he was in the pond.  What to the
devil's going to happen now?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen," said Mr. Wriford; but they had scarcely
listened a minute before there happened a sound of
breaking glass in an adjoining room.  "They're
getting in through a window," cried Mr. Wriford.  "We
must keep them out."
</p>

<p>
Several doors led from the spacious old hall in which
they stood, and Mr. Puddlebox, choosing one, chose
the wrong one, for here was an apartment whose window
stood intact and beyond which the sounds of entry
could still be heard.  A further door in this room that
might have led to them was found to be locked and
without key.  Mr. Puddlebox and Mr. Wriford charged
back to the hall, down the hall alongside this room,
through a door which led to a passage behind it, and
thence through another door which revealed one gentleman
in his nightshirt, yellow and black with mire from
head to foot, who was reaching down a wide-mouthed
gun from the wall, and another gentleman in corduroys,
having a bucolic countenance which was very white,
who in the act of entry had one leg on the floor and
the other through the window.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
"If they've got in we'll run for it," Mr. Puddlebox
had said as they came down the passage.  But the room
was entered so impetuously that the only running done
was, perforce, into it, and at that with a stumbling rush
on the part of Mr. Puddlebox into the back of the nightshirt
and the collapse of Mr. Wriford over Mr. Puddlebox's
heels upon him.  Mr. Puddlebox encircled the
nightshirt about its waist with his arms; the nightshirt,
gun in hand, staggered towards the corduroy and with
the gun swept its supporting leg from under it; the gun
discharged itself through its bell-shaped mouth with an
appalling explosion; the corduroy with a loud shriek
to the effect that he was dead fell upon the head of the
nightshirt; and there was immediately a tumult of four
bodies with sixteen whirling legs and arms, no party to
which had any clear perception as to the limbs that
belonged to himself, or any other strategy of campaign
than to claw and thump at whatever portion of whoever's
body offered itself for the process.  There were,
with all this, cries of very many kinds and much
obscenity of meaning, changing thrice to a universal
bellow of horror as first a table and its contents
discharged itself upon the mass, then a dresser with an
artillery of plates and dishes, and finally a grandfather
clock which, descending sideways along the wall, swept
with it a comprehensive array of mural decorations.
</p>

<p>
Assortment of arms and legs was at length begun out
of all this welter by the corduroyed gentleman who,
finding himself not dead as he had believed, but in great
danger of reaching that state in some very horrible
form, found also his own hands and knees and upon
them crawled away very rapidly towards an adjoining
room whose door stood invitingly open.  There were
fastened to his legs as he did so a pair of hands whose
owner he first drew after him, then dislodged by, on the
threshold of the open door, beating at them with a
broken plate, and having done so, sprung upright to
make for safety.  The owner of the hands however
sprung with him, attached them&mdash;and it was
Mr. Wriford&mdash;to his throat, and thrust him backwards into
the adjoining room and into the midst of several shallow
pans of milk with which the floor of this room was set.
</p>

<p>
This apartment was, in fact, the dairy; and here,
while thunder and crashing proceeded from the other
room in which Mr. Puddlebox and the nightshirt
weltered, extraordinary contortions to the tune of great
splashing and tin-pan crashing were forced upon the
corduroyed gentleman by Mr. Wriford's hands at his
throat.  Broad shelves encircled this room, and first
the corduroyed gentleman was bent backwards over the
lowest of these until the back of his head adhered to
some pounds of butter, then whirled about and bent
sideways until in some peril of meeting his end by
suffocation in cream, then inclined to the other side until
a basket of eggs were no longer at their highest market
value, and finally hurled from Mr. Wriford to go full
length and with a large white splash into what pans of
milk remained in position on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, with a loud "Ha!" of triumph, and
feeling, though greatly bruised in the first portion of the
fight and much besmeared with dairy-produce in the
second, much more of a man than he had ever felt
before, then dashed through the door and locked it upon
the corduroy's struggles to free himself from death in a
milky grave, and then prepared to give fierce assistance
to the drier but as deadly fray still waging between
Mr. Puddlebox and the nightshirt.
</p>

<p>
Upon the welter of crockery and other debris here to
view, these combatants appeared to be practising for
a combined rolling match, or to be engaged in rolling the
litter into a smooth and equable surface.  Locked very
closely together by their arms, and with equal intensity
by their legs, they rolled first to one end of the room or
to a piece of overturned furniture and then, as if by
common consent, back again to the other end or to
another obstacle.  This they performed with immense
swiftness and with no vocal sounds save very distressed
breathing as they rolled and very loud and simultaneous
<i>Ur!</i> as they checked at the end of a roll and started
back for the next.
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Wriford watched, himself breathing immensely
after his own exertions yet laughing excitedly at what he
saw, he was given opportunity of taking part by the
rollers introducing a new diversion into their exercise.
This was provided by the grandfather clock, which,
embedded in the debris like a partly submerged coffin,
now obstructed their progress.  A common spirit of
splendid determination not to be stopped by it appeared
simultaneously to animate them.  With one very loud <i>Ur!</i>
they came against it; with a secondhand a third and
each time a louder <i>Ur!</i> charged it again and again; with
a fourth <i>Ur!</i> magnificently mounted it; and with a
fifth, the debris on this side being lower, plunged down
from it.  The shock in some degree relaxed their
embrace one with the other.  From their locked forms a
pair of naked legs upshot.  Mr. Wriford jumped for
the ankles, clutched them amain, and with the
information "I've got his legs!" and with its effect,
encouraged Mr. Puddlebox to a mighty effort, whereby
at length he broke free from the other's grasp, sat
upright upon the nightshirt's chest, and then, securing
its arms, faced about towards Mr. Wriford, and seated
himself upon the nightshirt's forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Where's yours?" said Mr. Puddlebox, when he
had collected sufficient breath for the question.
</p>

<p>
"Locked up in there," said Mr. Wriford, nodding
his head towards the dairy.
</p>

<p>
"Loony," said Mr. Puddlebox, "this has been the
most devil of a thing that ever any man has been in,
and I challenge you or any man ever to have been in a
worse."
</p>

<p>
"I'll have you in a worse," bawled the nightshirt.
"I'll&mdash;" and as though incapable of giving sufficient
words to his intentions he opened his mouth very
widely and emitted from it a long and roaring bellow.
Into this cavern of his jaws Mr. Puddlebox, now kneeling
on the nightshirt's arms, dropped a cloth cap very
conveniently abandoned by the corduroy; and then,
facing across the prostrate form, Mr. Puddlebox and
Mr. Wriford went into a hysteria of laughter only
checked at last by the nightshirt, successfully
advantaging himself of the weakening effect of their mirth,
making a tremendous struggle to overthrow them.
</p>

<p>
"But, loony," said Mr. Puddlebox when the farmer
was again mastered, "we are best out of this, for such
a battle I could by no means fight again."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't care," said Mr. Wriford.  "I don't
care a dash what happens or who comes.  Still, we'd
better go.  First we must tie this chap up and then
clean ourselves.  My man's all right in there.  There's
no window where he is&mdash;only a grating round the top.
I'll find something to fix this one with if you can hold
his legs."
</p>

<p>
This Mr. Puddlebox, by kneeling upon the nightshirt's
arms and stretching over them to his legs, was able to
do, and Mr. Wriford, voyaging the dishevelled room,
gave presently a gleeful laugh and presented himself
before Mr. Puddlebox with a wooden box and with
information that made Mr. Puddlebox laugh also and the
nightshirt, unable to shout, to express his personal view
in new and tremendous struggles.
</p>

<p>
"Nails," said Mr. Wriford, "and a hammer.  We'll
nail him down;" and very methodically, working along
each side of each extended arm, and down each border
of the nightshirt pulled taut across his person, proceeded
to attach the yellow-toothed gentleman to the floor
more literally and more closely than any occupier,
unless similarly fastened, can ever have been attached
to his boyhood's home.
</p>

<p>
"There!" said Mr. Wriford, stepping back and regarding
his handiwork, which was indeed very creditably
performed, with conscionable satisfaction.  "There
you are, my boy, as tight as a sardine lid, and if you
utter a sound you'll get one through your head as
well."
</p>

<p>
This, however, was a contingency which the nightshirt,
thanks to the cap in his mouth, was in no great
danger of arousing, and leaving him to enjoy the flavour
of his gag and his unique metallic bordering, which from
the hue of his countenance and the flame of his eyes
he appeared indisposed to do, there now followed on the
part of Mr. Wriford and Mr. Puddlebox a very welcome
and a highly necessary adjustment of their toilets.  It
was performed by Mr. Puddlebox with his mouth
prodigiously distended with a meal collected from the
kitchen, and by Mr. Wriford, as he cooled, with
astonished reflection upon the extraordinary escapades which
he had now added to his exploits of the previous day.
"Well, this is a most extraordinary state of affairs for
me," reflected Mr. Wriford, much as he had reflected
earlier in the morning.  "Most extraordinary, I'm
dashed if it isn't!  I've pretty well killed a chap and
drowned him in milk; and I've slung a chap into a pond
and then nailed him down by his nightshirt.  Well, I'm
doing things at last; and I don't care a dash what
happens; and I don't care a dash what comes next."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Now this cogitation took place in an upper room
whither Mr. Wriford had repaired in quest of soap and
brushes, and what came next came at once and came
very quickly, being first reported by Mr. Puddlebox,
who at this point rushed up-stairs to announce as
rapidly as his distended mouth would permit: "Loony,
there's a cart come up to the door with four men in
it&mdash;hulkers!" and next illustrated by a loud knocking
responsive to which there immediately arose from the
imprisoned corduroy a great shouting and from the
gagged and nailed-down nightshirt a muffled blaring as
of a cow restrained from its calf.
</p>

<p>
Very much quicker than might be supposed, and
while Mr. Puddlebox and Mr. Wriford stared one upon
the other in irresolute concern, these sounds blended into
an enormous hullabaloo below stairs which spoke of the
entry by the window of the new arrivals, of the release
from his gag of the nailed-down nightshirt and from his
milky gaol of the imprisoned corduroy, and finally of
wild and threatening search which now came pouring
very alarmingly up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford locked the door, Mr. Puddlebox opened
the window, and immediately their door was first
rattled with cries of "Here they are!" and then
assailed by propulsion against it of very violent bodies.
</p>

<p>
The drop from the window was not one to be taken in
cold blood.  It was taken, nevertheless, side by side and
at hurtling speed by Mr. Wriford and by Mr. Puddlebox
through each half of the casement; and this done, and
the concussion recovered from, the farm surroundings
which divided them from the road were taken also at
headlong bounds accelerated when midway across by
a loud crash and by ferocious view-hulloas from the
window.
</p>

<p>
The boundary hedge was gained.  There was presented
to the fugitives a roadside inn having before it,
travel-stained, throbbing, and unattended, a very
handsome touring motor-car.  There was urged upon their
resources as they jumped to the road the sight of two
men red-hot in their rear and, more alarmingly, three
led by the milky corduroy short-cutting towards their
flank.
</p>

<p>
"Blink!" gasped Mr. Puddlebox.  "Blink!  Hide!"
and ran two bewildered paces up the road and three
distracted paces down it.
</p>

<p>
"Hide where?" panted Mr. Wriford, his wits much
shaken by his run, by the close sight of the pursuit, and
more than ever by Mr. Puddlebox bumping into him as
he turned in his first irresolution and colliding with him
again as he turned in his second.
</p>

<p>
"Blink!&mdash;Here," cried Mr. Puddlebox, made a dash
at the motor-car&mdash;Mr. Wriford in bewildered confusion
on his heels&mdash;opened the door, and closing it behind
them, crouched with Mr. Wriford on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Run for it the opposite way as soon as they pass
us," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "This is a very devil of a
business, and I will challenge&mdash;Here they come!"
</p>

<p>
But, quicker than they, came also another, and he
from the inn.  This was a young man in livery of a
chauffeur, who emerged very hurriedly wiping his mouth
and telling the landlord who followed him: "My
gov'nor won't be half wild if I ain't there by two
o'clock."  With which he jumped very nimbly to his
wheel, released his clutch, and with no more than a
glance at the milky corduroy and his friends who now
came baying down the hedge, was in a moment bearing
Mr. Puddlebox and Mr. Wriford at immense speed
towards wherever it was that his impatient gov'nor
awaited him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford put his hands to his head and said, more
to himself than to Mr. Puddlebox: "Well, this is the
most extraordinary&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox settled his back against the seat, and
cocking a very merry eye at Mr. Wriford, chanted with
enormous fervour:
</p>

<p>
"O ye motors of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise
Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0208"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
FIRST PERSON EXTRAORDINARY
</h3>

<p>
"Well&mdash;" said Mr. Wriford to himself.
</p>

<p>
There is to be added here, as bringing Mr. Wriford
to this exclamation, that at midday the chauffeur,
having whirled through rural England at great speed
for some hours on end, again drew up at a roadside inn
no less isolated than that at which he had first
accommodated his passengers, and had no sooner repaired
within than Mr. Puddlebox, first protruding a cautious
head and finding no soul in sight, then led out the way
through the further door and then up the road until a
friendly hedgeside invited them to rest and to the
various foods which Mr. Puddlebox had brought from
the farm and now produced from his pockets.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford ate in silence, and nothing that
Mr. Puddlebox could say could fetch him from his thoughts.
"Well," thought Mr. Wriford, "this is the most
extraordinary state of affairs!  A week ago I was an
editor in London and afraid of everything and everybody.
Now I've been in the river, and I've stolen a ride
in a wagon, and I've had a devil of a fight with a
wagoner, and I've kicked a policeman head over heels
bang into a ditch, and I've nearly been burnt alive,
and I've broken out through the roof of a barn and
fallen a frightful buster off it, and I've slung a chap
into a pond, and I've nearly killed a chap and
half-drowned him in milk, and I've nailed a man to the
floor by his nightshirt, and I've jumped out of a high
window and been chased for my life, and I've stolen
a ride in a motor-car, and where the devil I am now
I haven't the remotest idea.  Well, it's the most
extraordinary&mdash;!"

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
BODY WORK
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
It was in early May that Mr. Wriford cast himself
into the river.  Declining Summer, sullied in her
raiment by September's hand, slain by October's, found
him still in Mr. Puddlebox's company.  But a different
Wriford from him whom that jolly gentleman had first
met upon the road from Barnet.  In body a harder man,
what of the open life, the mad adventures, and of the
casual work&mdash;all manual work&mdash;in farm and field
that supplied their necessaries when these ran short.
And harder man in soul.  "You're a confirmed rascal,
sir," addressed him the chairman of a Bench of country
magistrates before whom&mdash;and not their first experience
of such&mdash;he and Mr. Puddlebox once were haled,
their offence that they had been found sleeping in the
outbuildings of a rural parsonage.
</p>

<p>
The rector, a gentleman, appearing unwillingly to
prosecute, pleaded for the prisoners.  A trivial offence,
he urged&mdash;a stormy night on which he would gladly
have given them shelter had they asked for it, and he
turned to the dock with: "Why did you not come and
ask for it, my friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, there'd have been no fun in doing that!" said
Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Fun!" exclaimed the rector.  "No, no fun perhaps.
But a hearty welcome I&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, keep your hearty welcomes to yourself!" cried
Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
And then the chairman: "You're a confirmed rascal,
sir.  A confirmed and stubborn rascal.  When our
good vicar&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you're a self-important, over-fed, and very
gross-looking pomposity," returned Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Seven days," said the chairman, very swollen.
"Take them away, constable."
</p>

<p>
"Curse me," said Mr. Puddlebox when, accommodated
for the night in adjoining cells, they conversed
over the partition that divided them.  "Curse me,
you're no better than a fool, loony, and I challenge any
man to be a bigger.  Here we are at these vile tasks
for a week and would have got away scot free and a
shilling from the parson but for your fool's tongue."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I had to say something to stir them up,"
explained Mr. Wriford.  "I must be doing something all
the time, or I get&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's better things to do than this cursed
foolishness," grumbled Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
"It's new to me," said Mr. Wriford.  "That's what
I want."
</p>

<p>
That indeed was what he wanted in these months
and ever sought with sudden bursts of fierceness or of
irresponsible prankishness.  He must be doing
something all the time and doing something that brought
reprisals, either in form of fatigue that followed hard
work in their odd jobs&mdash;digging, carting stable refuse,
hoeing a long patch of root crops, harvesting which
gave the pair steady employment and left them at the
turn of the year with a stock of shillings in hand,
roadside work where labour had fallen short and a builder
was behindhand with a contract for some cottages&mdash;or
in form of punishment such as followed his truculence
before the magistrate or was got by escapades of the
nature of their early adventures.
</p>

<p>
Something that brought reprisals, something to be
felt in his body.  "Why, you don't understand, you
see," Mr. Wriford would cry, responsive to remonstrance
from Mr. Puddlebox.  "All my life I've felt things
here&mdash;here in my head," and he would strike his head hard
and begin to speak loudly and very fiercely and quickly,
so that often his words rolled themselves together or
were several times repeated.  "In my head, head,
head&mdash;all mixed up and whirling there so I felt I must
scream to let it all out: scream out senseless words and
loud roars like uggranddlearrrrohohohgarragarragaddaurrr!
Now my head's empty, empty, empty, and I
can smash at it as if it didn't belong to me.  Look here!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, stop it, boy, stop it!" Mr. Puddlebox would
cry, and catch at Mr. Wriford's fist that banged in
illustration.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just to show you.  Man alive, I've stood
sometimes in my office with my head in such a whirling
crash, and feeling so sick and frightened&mdash;that always
went with it&mdash;that I've felt I must catch by the throat
the next man who came in and kill him dead before he
could speak to me.  In my head, man, in my
head&mdash;felt things all my life in my head: and in my heart;"
and Mr. Wriford would strike himself fiercely upon his
breast.  "Felt things in my heart so I was always in a
torment and always tying myself up tighter and tighter
and tighter&mdash;not doing this because I thought it was
unkind to this person; and doing that because I thought
I ought to do it for that person&mdash;messing, messing,
messing round and spoiling my life with rotten
sentiment and rotten ideas of rotten duty.  God, when I
think of the welter of it all!  Now, my boy, it's all
over!  My head's as empty as an empty bucket and
so's my heart.  I don't care a curse for anybody or
anything.  I'm beginning to do what I ought to have done
years ago&mdash;enjoy myself.  It's only my body now; I
want to ache it and feel it and hurt it and keep it going
all the time.  If I don't, if I stop going and going and
going, I begin to think; and if I begin to think I
begin to go back again.  Then up I jump, my boy, and
let fly at somebody again, or dig or whatever the work
is, as if the devil was in me and until my body is ready
to break, and then I say to my body: 'Go on, you
devil; go on.  I'll keep you at it till you drop.  You've
been getting soft and rotten while my head was working
and driving me.  Now it's your turn.  But you don't
drive me, my boy; I drive you.  Get at it!'  That's the
way of it, Puddlebox.  I'm free now, and I'm enjoying
myself, and I want to go on doing new things and doing
them hard, always and all the time.  Now then!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox: "Sure you're enjoying yourself, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course I am.  When it was all this cursed
head and all worry I didn't belong to myself.  Now it's
all body, and I'm my own.  I've missed something all
my life.  Now I'm finding it.  I'm finding what it is to
be happy&mdash;it's not to care.  That's the secret of it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox would shake his head.  "That's not
the secret of it, boy."
</p>

<p>
"What is, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what I've told you: not to think so much
about yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just what I'm doing.  I'm not caring
a curse what happens to me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and thinking about that all the time.  That's
just where you're spooked, boy."
</p>

<p>
"Spooked!" Mr. Wriford would cry with an easy
laugh.  "That's seeing myself like I used to.  I've not
seen myself for weeks&mdash;months."
</p>

<p>
"But you're not unspooked yet, boy," Mr. Puddlebox
would return.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
They were come west in their tramping&mdash;set in that
quarter by the motor-car that had run them from that
early adventure with the nightshirted and the corduroyed
gentlemen.  It had alighted them in Wiltshire, and
they continued, while splendid summer in imperial days
and pageant nights attended them, by easy and
haphazard stages down into Dorset and thence through
Somerset and Devon into Cornwall by the sea.
</p>

<p>
Many amazements in these counties and in these
months&mdash;some of a train with those afforded by the
liver-cutting wagoner and by the yellow-toothed farmer
bent upon arson; some quieter, but to Mr. Wriford, if
he permitted thought, not less amazing&mdash;as when he
found himself working with his hands and in his sweat
for manual wages; some in outrage of law and morals
that had shocked the Mr. Wriford of the London days.
He must be doing something, as he had told Mr. Puddlebox,
and doing something all the time.  What he did
not tell was that these things&mdash;when they were wild,
irresponsible, grotesque, wrong, immoral&mdash;-were done
by conscious effort before they were entered upon.
Mr. Wriford used to&mdash;had to&mdash;dare himself to do them.
"Now, here you are!" Mr. Wriford would say to himself
when by freakish thought some opportunity offered
itself.  "Here you are!  Ah, you funk it!  I knew you
would.  I thought so.  You funk it!"  And then, thus
taunted, would come the sudden burst of fierceness or
of irresponsible prankishness, and Mr. Wriford would
rush at the thing fiercely, and fiercely begin it, and with
increasing fierceness carry it to settlement&mdash;one way
or the other.
</p>

<p>
Once, up from a roadside to a labourer who came
sturdily by, "I'll fight you for tuppence!" cried
Mr. Wriford, facing him.  "Ba goom, I'll faight thee for
nowt!" said the man and knocked him down, and when
again he rushed, furious and bleeding, smashed him
again, and laughing at the ease of it, trod on his way.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why to the devil did you do such a mad
thing?" said Mr. Puddlebox, awakened from a doze
and tending Mr. Wriford's hurts.  "Where to the devil
is the sense of such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought of it as he came along," said Mr. Wriford,
"and I had to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Why, curse me," cried Mr. Puddlebox, "I mustn't
even sleep for your madness, boy."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've done it," Mr. Wriford returned, much
hurt but fiercely glad.  "I've done it, and I'm happy.
If I hadn't&mdash;oh, you wouldn't understand.  That's
enough.  Let it bleed.  Let the damned thing bleed.
I like to see it."
</p>

<p>
He used to like to sit and count his bruises.  He used
to like, after hard work on some employment, to sit
and reckon which muscles ached him most and then
to spring up and exercise them so they ached anew.
He used to like to sit and count over and over again the
money that their casual labours earned him.  These&mdash;bruises,
and aches and shillings&mdash;were the indisputable
testimony to his freedom, to the fact that he at last
was doing things, to the reprisals against which he set
his body and full earned.  He used to like to go long
periods without food.  He used to like, when rain fell
and Mr. Puddlebox sought shelter, to stand out in the
soak of it and feel its soak.  These&mdash;fastings and
discomforts&mdash;were manifests that his body was suffering
things, and that he was its master and his own.
</p>

<p>
Through all these excesses&mdash;checking him in many,
from many dissuading him, in their results supporting
him&mdash;Mr. Puddlebox stuck to him.  That soft, fat,
kindly and protective hand came often between him
and self-invited violence from strangers by
Mr. Puddlebox&mdash;when Mr. Wriford was not looking&mdash;tapping his
head and accompanying the sign with nods and frowns
in further illustration, or by more active rescues from
his escapades.  Chiefly Mr. Puddlebox employed his
unfailing good-humour as deterrent of Mr. Wriford's
fierceness.  He learnt to let the starvation, or the
exposure to the elements, or the engagement in some wild
escapade, go to a certain pitch, then to argue with
Mr. Wriford until he made him angry, then by some jovial
whimsicality to bring him against his will to
involuntary laughter; then Mr. Wriford would be pliable,
consent to eat, to take shelter, to cease his folly.  Much
further than this Mr. Puddlebox carried the affection
he had conceived for Mr. Wriford&mdash;and all it cost him.
Once when lamentably far gone in his cups, he was
startled out of their effects by becoming aware that
Mr. Wriford was producing from his pockets articles
that glistened beneath the moon where it lit the
open-air resting-place to which he had no recollection of
having come.
</p>

<p>
He stared amazed at two watches, a small clock,
spoons, and some silver trinkets; and soon by further
amazement was completely sobered.  "I've done it,"
said Mr. Wriford, and in his eyes could be seen the
gleam, and in his voice heard the nervous exaltation, that
always went with accomplishment of any of his fiercenesses.
"I've done it!  It was a devil of a thing&mdash;right
into two bedrooms&mdash;but I've done it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox in immense horror: "Done what?"
</p>

<p>
"Broken in there," and Mr. Wriford jerked back his
head in "there's" indication, and Mr. Puddlebox, to
his new and frantic alarm, found that a large house
stood within fifty paces of them, they in its garden.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you're&mdash;hup!"&mdash;cried Mr. Puddlebox&mdash;"Blink!
Why, what to the devil do you mean&mdash;broken
in there?  What are we,&mdash;hup, blink!&mdash;doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, we had a bet," said Mr. Wriford, looking over
his prizes and clearly much pleased with himself.  "I
bet you as we came down the road that I'd break in here
before you would.  I took the front and you went to
the back, but you've been asleep."
</p>

<p>
"Asleep!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "I've been drunk.
I was drunk."  He got on his knees from where he sat
and with a furious action fumbled in his coat-tails.
From them his bottle of whisky, and Mr. Puddlebox
furiously wrenched the cork and hurled the bottle from
him.  "To hell with it!" cried Mr. Puddlebox as it lay
gurgling.  "Hell take it.  I'll not touch it again.  Why,
loony&mdash;why, you staring, hup! hell! mad loony, if
you'd been caught you'd have gone to convict prison,
boy.  And my fault for this cursed drink.  Give me those
things.  Give them to me and get out of here&mdash;get
up the road."
</p>

<p>
"Let 'em alone!" said Mr. Wriford menacingly.
"What d'you want with 'em?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox played the game learnt of experience.
He concealed his agitation.  He said with his jolly smile:
"Why, mean that I will not be beat at anything by you
or by any man.  I will challenge you or any man at any
game and will be beat by none.  You've been in and got
'em, boy; now, curse me, I will equal you and beat you
for that I will go in and put them back.  Play fair,
boy.  Hand over."
</p>

<p>
"Well, there you are," said Mr. Wriford, disarmed
and much tickled.
</p>

<p>
"Out you go then, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox, gathering
up the trinkets.  "Out into the road.  You had
none of me to interfere with you, and I must have none
of you while I go my own way to this."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox took Mr. Wriford to the gate of the
grounds, then went back again in much trembling.  An
open window informed him of Mr. Wriford's place of
entry.  He leant through to a sofa that stood handy,
there deposited the trinkets, and very softly shut the
window down.  When he rejoined Mr. Wriford, fear's
perspiration was streaming from him.  "I've had a
squeak of it," said Mr. Puddlebox with simulated
cheeriness.  "Let's out of this, and I'll tell you."
</p>

<p>
He walked Mr. Wriford long, quickly and far.  While
he walked he fought again the battle that had been
swift victory when he cast his bottle from him; and in
future days fought it again and met new tortures in each
fight.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going to get any whisky?" asked
Mr. Wriford when on a day, pockets lined with harvest
money, he noticed Mr. Puddlebox's abstinence.
</p>

<p>
"Whisky!  Hell take such stinking stuff," cried
Mr. Puddlebox and sucked in his cheeks&mdash;and groaned;
then put a hand in his tail-pocket and felt a hard
lump rolled in a cloth that lay where the whisky
used to lie and said to himself: "Two bottles&mdash;two
bottles."
</p>

<p>
It was Mr. Puddlebox's promise to himself, and his
lustiest weapon in his battles with his desire, that, on
some day that must come somehow, the day when he
should be relieved of his charge of Mr. Wriford, he
would buy himself two bottles of whisky and sit himself
down and drink them.  Into the hard lump rolled in
the cloth, and composing it, there went daily when his
earnings permitted it two coppers.  When that sum
reached eighty-four&mdash;two at three-and-six apiece&mdash;his
two bottles would be ready for the mere asking.
</p>

<p>
Wherefore "Two bottles!  Two bottles!" Mr. Puddlebox
would assure himself when most fiercely his cravings
assailed him, and against the pangs of his denial would
combine luxurious thoughts of when they should thus
be slaked and fears of what might happen to his loony
if he now gave way to them.
</p>

<p>
Much those fears&mdash;or the affection whence they
rose&mdash;cost him in these later days: swiftly their end
approached.  Much and more as summer passed and
autumn came sombrely and chill: swiftly their end as
sombre day succeeded sombre day, and they passed
down into Cornwall and went along the sombre sea.
Village to village, through nature in decay that grey
sky shrouded, grey sea dirged: Mr. Puddlebox ever for
tarrying when larger town was reached, Mr. Wriford
ever for onward&mdash;onward, on.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0302"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
CROSS WORK
</h3>

<p>
Ever for onward, Mr. Wriford&mdash;onward, onward, on!
</p>

<p>
Where, in the bright days, Mr. Puddlebox had taken
the lead and suggested their road and programme, now,
in the sombre days, chill in the air, and in the wind a
bluster, Mr. Wriford led.  He chose the roughest paths.
He most preferred the cliff tracks where wind and rain
drove strongest, or down upon the shingle where walking
was mostly climbing the great boulders that ran from
cliff to sea.  He walked with head up as though to show
the weather how he scorned it.  He walked very fast
as though there was something he pursued.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox did not like it at all.  Much of
Mr. Puddlebox's jolly humour was shaken out of him in these
rough and arduous scrambles, and he grumbled loud and
frequent.  But very fond of his loony, Mr. Puddlebox,
and increasingly anxious for him in this fiercer mood of
his.
</p>

<p>
There are limits, though: and these came on an
afternoon wild and wet when Mr. Wriford exchanged the
cliff road for the shore and pressed his way at his relentless
pace along a desolate stretch cut into frequent inlets
by rocky barriers that must be toilsomely climbed, a
dun sea roaring at them.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what to the devil is it you're chasing, boy?"
Mr. Puddlebox's grumblings at last broke out, when yet
another barrier surmounted revealed another and a
steeper little beyond.  "Here's a warm town we've
left," cried Mr. Puddlebox, sinking upon a great stone,
"and here's as wet, cold, and infernal a climbing as I
challenge you or any man ever to have seen.  Here's
you been dragging and trailing and ripe for anything
these three months and more, and now rushing and
stopping for nothing so I challenge the devil himself to
keep up with you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't keep up!" said Mr. Wriford fiercely.
"Who wants you to?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox blinked at that; but he answered
stoutly: "Well, curse me if I do, for one."
</p>

<p>
"Nor me for another," said Mr. Wriford and turned
where he stood and pressed on across the shingle towards
the next rocky arm.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox sucked in his cheeks, felt at the hard
lump in his pocket, then followed at a little run, and
caught Mr. Wriford as Mr. Wriford climbed the further
barrier of rocks.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, give us a hand, boy," cried Mr. Puddlebox
cheerfully.  "This is a steep one."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford looked down.  "What, are you coming
on?  I thought you'd stopped."
</p>

<p>
"You're unkind, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, looking down, this time saw the blink
that went with the words.  He jumped back lower,
coming with reckless bounds.  "I'm sorry," he said.
"I'm sorry.  Look here, coming across this bit"&mdash;he
pointed back to their earlier stopping-place&mdash;"I
felt&mdash;I felt <i>rotten</i> to think you'd gone."
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's my loony!" cried Mr. Puddlebox,
highly pleased.  "Come down here, boy.  Let's talk of
this business."
</p>

<p>
"But I wouldn't look back," said Mr. Wriford, "or
come back.  I've done with that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
"Why, so you have," said Mr. Puddlebox, rightly
guessing to what Mr. Wriford referred.  "You can come
down now, though, for I'm asking you to, so there's no
weakness in that.  There's shelter here."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want shelter," said Mr. Wriford, and went
a step higher and stood with head and back erect where
gale and rain caught him more full.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox summoned much impressiveness into
his voice.  "Boy," said Mr. Puddlebox, "this is a fool's
game, and I never saw such even with you.  Bring
sense to it, boy.  Tramping is well enough for fine days:
winters for towns.  There's money to be found in towns,
boy; and if no money, workhouse is none so bad, and
when we've tried it you've liked it and called it
something new, which is what you want.  Well, there's
nothing new this way, boy.  There's no work and there's no
bed in the fields winter-time.  Nothing new this way,
boy."
</p>

<p>
A fiercer drive of wind spun Mr. Wriford where he
stood exposed.  He caught at a rock with his hands and
laughed grimly, then stood erect again, and pressed
himself against the rising gale.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, isn't there, though?" he cried.  "Man, there's
cold and rain and wind, and there's tramping on
and on against it and feeling you don't care a damn
for it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, curse me, but I do," returned Mr. Puddlebox.
"It's just what I do mind, and there's no sense to it,
boy.  There's no sense to it."
</p>

<p>
"There is for me," Mr. Wriford cried.  "It's what I
want!"  He turned from fronting the gale.  Mr. Puddlebox
saw him measuring with his eye the height where
he stood from the ground, and called in swift alarm:
"Don't jump!  You'll break your legs.  Don't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford laughed aloud, jumped and came crashing
to his hands and knees, got up and laughed again.
"That's all right!" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Boy, that's all wrong," said Mr. Puddlebox very
seriously.  "That's all of a part with your rushing along
as if it was the devil himself you chased; and what to
the devil else it can be I challenge you to say or any
man."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford took up the words he had cried down
from the top of the barrier.  "It's what I want," he
told Mr. Puddlebox.  "Cold and not minding it, and
fighting against the wind and not minding it, and getting
wet and going on full speed however rough the road
and not minding that.  Cold and wind and rain and
sticking to it and fighting it and beating it and liking
it&mdash;ah!" and he threw up his arms, extending them,
and filled his chest with a great breath, as though he
embraced and drunk deep of the elements that he stuck
to and fought and beat.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox looked at him closely.  "Sure you're
liking it?" he asked, his tone the same as when he often
inquired: "Sure you're happy, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Why, of course I'm sure.  Why, all the time
I'm thrashing along, do you know what I'm saying?
I'm saying: 'Beating you!  Beating you!  Beating you!'
and at night I lie awake and think of it all waiting
outside for me and how I shall beat it, beat it, beat it
again when morning comes."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down," said Mr. Puddlebox.  "I've something
to say to you."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll stand," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you tired?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm fit to drop," said Mr. Wriford; and then with
a hard face: "But sitting down is giving way to it.
I'll not do that.  No, by God, I'll beat it all the time."
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Puddlebox broke out in exasperation and
struck his stick upon the shingle to mark it.  "Why,
curse me if I ever heard such a thing or knew such a
thing!" cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "Beating it!  I've told
you a score time, and this time I give it to you hot, that
when you go so, you're spooked, spooked to hell and
never will be unspooked!  'Beating it, beating it, beating
it!' you cry as you rush along!  Why, it's then that
it is beating you all the time, for it is of yourself that
you are thinking.  And that's what's wrong with you,
thinking of yourself, and has always been.  And there's
no being happy that way and never will be.  Think of
some one else, boy.  For God Almighty's sake think
of some one else or you're beat and mad for sure!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford gave him back his fierceness.  "Think
of some one else!  That's what I've done all my life.
That's what locked me up and did for me.  I've done
with all that now, and I'm happy.  Think of some one
else!  God!" cried he and snapped his fingers.  "I
don't care that for anybody.  Whom should I think
of?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, try a thought for me," cried Mr. Puddlebox,
relenting nothing of his own heat.  "I've watched you
these four months.  I've got you out of trouble.  Curse
me, I've fed you and handled you like a baby.  But for
me you'd like be lying dead somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Well, who cares?" cried Mr. Wriford.  "Not me,
I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, and you'd liker still be clapped in an asylum
and locked there all your days; you'd mind that.  But
for me that's where you'd be and where you'll go, if I
left you to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford cried with a black and angry face:
"Well, if it's true, who asked you to hang on to me?
Why have you done it?  If it's true, mind you!  For
I've done my share.  You've admitted that yourself.
In the rows we've got into I've done my share, and in
the work we've done I've done more than my share,
once I've learnt the hang of it.  Now then!  That's
true, isn't it?  If you've done so jolly much, why have
you?  There's one for you.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
His violent storming put a new mood to Mr. Puddlebox's
face.  Not the exasperation with which he had
burst out and continued till now.  That left him.  Not
the jolly grin with which commonly he regarded life in
general and Mr. Wriford in particular.  None of these.
A new mood.  The mood and hue Mr. Wriford had
glimpsed when, looking down from the barrier as
Mr. Puddlebox overtook him, and crying down to him: "I
thought you'd stopped," he had seen Mr. Puddlebox
blink and heard him say: "You're unkind, boy."  Now
he saw it again&mdash;and was again to see it before
approaching night gave way to following morn.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox blinked and went redly cloudy in the
face.  "Why?" said he.  "Well, I'll tell you why, boy.
Because I like you.  I liked you, boy, when you came
wretched up the Barnet road and thought there was
one with you, following you.  I liked you then for you
were glad of my food and my help and caught at my
hand as night fell and held it while you slept.  Curse
me, I liked you then, for, curse me, you were the first
come my way in many years of sin that thought me
stronger than himself and that I could be stronger to
and could help.  I liked you then, boy, and I've liked
you more each sun and moon since.  I've lost a precious
lot in life through being what, curse me, I am.  None ever
to welcome me, none ever to be glad of me, none ever
that minded if I rode by on my legs or went legs first in
a coffin cart.  Then came you that was loony, that was
glad of me here and glad of me there, that asked me this
and asked me that, that laughed with me and ate with
me and slept with me, that because you was loony was
weaker than me.  So I liked you, boy; curse me, I
loved you, boy.  There's why for you."
</p>

<p>
This long speech, delivered with much blinking and
redness of the face, was listened to by Mr. Wriford with
the fierceness gone out of his eyes but with his face
twisting and working as though what he heard put him
in difficulty.  In difficulty and with difficulty he then
broke out.  "God knows I'm grateful," Mr. Wriford
said, his voice strained as his face.  "But look at
this&mdash;I don't want to be grateful.  I don't want that kind
of thing.  I've been through all that.  'Thank you'
for this; and 'Thank you' for that; and 'I beg your
pardon;' and 'Oh, how kind of you.'  Man, man!" cried
Mr. Wriford, striking his hands to his face and tearing
them away again as though scenes were before his eyes
that he would wrench away.  "Man, I've done that
thirty years and been killed of it.  I don't want ever to
think that kind of stuff again.  I want just to keep
going on and having nothing touch me except what
hurts me here in my body and not care a damn for
it&mdash;which I don't.  You're always asking me if I'm happy,
and I know you think I'm not.  But I am.  Look how
hard my hands are: that makes me happy just to think
of that.  And how I don't mind getting wet or cold:
that makes me happy, so happy that I shout out with
the gladness of it and get myself wetter.  It's being a
man.  It's getting the better of myself.  You're going
to say it's not.  But you don't understand.  One man
has to get the better of himself one way and one another.
With me it's getting the better of being afraid of things.
Well, I'm beating it.  I'm beating it when I'm out here,
tramping along.  But when I'm sheltering it's beating
me.  When you tell me&mdash;"  He stopped, and stooping
to Mr. Puddlebox took his hands and squeezed them so
that the water was squeezed to Mr. Puddlebox's eyes.
"There!" cried Mr. Wriford.  "Grateful!  I'm more
grateful to you.  I'm fonder of you than any man I've
ever met.  But don't tell me you're fond of me.
I don't want that from anybody.  When you tell
me that it puts me back to what I used to be.
I'm grateful.  Believe that; but don't make me talk
about it."
</p>

<p>
"I never did want you to," said Mr. Puddlebox.
"Look here, boy.  Look how we begun on this talk.
I told you to think of some one else, care for some one
else, and you broke out 'whom were you to care for?'
and I gave you, being cold and wet and mortal tired, I
gave you 'For God Almighty's sake care for me' and
then told you why you should.  Well, let's get back to
that.  Care for me.  Look here, boy.  We were ten
mile to the next village along this devil of a place when
we left the town.  I reckon we've come four, and here's
evening upon us and six to go.  Well, I can't go them,
and that's the end and the beginning of it.  I'm for
going back where there's a bed to be had and while yet
it is to be had, for they sleep early these parts.
Wherefore when I say 'for God Almighty's sake care for me,'
I mean stop this chasing this way and let's chase back
the way we come.  We'll forget what's gone between
us," concluded Mr. Puddlebox, reverting to his jolly
smiles and getting to his feet, "and I'll hate you and
you'll hate me, since that pleases you most, and back
we'll get and have a dish of potatoes inside of us and a
warm bed outside.  Wherefore I say:
</p>

<p>
"O ye food and warmth, bless ye the Lord: praise
Him and magnify Him for ever."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford laughed, and Mr. Puddlebox guessed
him persuaded once again.  But he set his face then
and shook his head sharply, and Mr. Puddlebox saw
him determined.  "No," said Mr. Wriford.  "No, I'm
not going back.  I'm never going back.  If you want
to know what I'm going to do, I'm going to stay the
night out here."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox cried: "Out here!  Now what to the
devil&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'd settled it," Mr. Wriford interrupted him.  "I'd
settled it when I thought you'd gone back.  There're
little caves all along here&mdash;I saw one the other side of
these rocks.  I'm going to sleep in one.  I'd made up
my mind when you caught up with me.  I'm going
to do it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox stared at him, incapable of speech.
Then cried: "Wet as you are?"
</p>

<p>
"Wet as I am," said Mr. Wriford and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Cold as it is and going to be colder?"
</p>

<p>
"Cold as it is and the colder the better."
</p>

<p>
"You'll stay alone," cried Mr. Puddlebox.  "Curse
me if I'll stay with you."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't," said Mr. Wriford.  "I'm not asking
you to."
</p>

<p>
"But you think I'm going to," cried Mr. Puddlebox.
"And you're wrong, for I'm not.  I'm going straight
back, and I'm going at once, the quicker to fetch you
to your senses.  I'm going, boy;" and in advertisement
of his intention Mr. Puddlebox began resolutely to move
away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford as resolutely turned to the barrier of
rocks and began to climb.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, boy," called Mr. Puddlebox.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford called back: "No.  No, I'm going to
stay.  I'm going to see the night through."
</p>

<p>
"You'll know where to find me," cried Mr. Puddlebox.
"I'll be where we lay last night."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's laugh came to him through the gathering
gloom, and through the gloom he saw Mr. Wriford's
form midway up the rocks.  "And you'll know where
to find me," Mr. Wriford called.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox paused irresolutely and cursed roundly
where he paused.  Then turned and stamped away
across the shingle.  When he reached the rocky arm
where first they had quarrelled he stopped again and
again looked back.  Mr. Wriford was not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"That'll go near to kill him if he stays," said
Mr. Puddlebox.  "And, curse me, if I go back to him he
will stay.  I'll push on, and he'll follow me.  That's the
only way to it."
</p>

<p>
They had spent the previous night in an eating-house
where "Beds for Single Men&mdash;4d." attracted
wanderers.  It was seven o'clock when Mr. Puddlebox's
slow progression&mdash;halting at every few yards and
looking back&mdash;at length returned him to it.  He dried
and warmed himself before the fire in the kitchen that
was free to inmates of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Where's your mate?" asked the proprietor.
"Thought you was making Port Rannock?"
</p>

<p>
"Too far," said Mr. Puddlebox; and to the earlier
question: "He's behind me.  I'll wait my supper till
he comes."
</p>

<p>
He waited, though very hungry.  Every time the door
of the kitchen opened he turned eagerly in expectation
that was every time denied.  Towards nine he gave up
the comfortable seat he had secured before the blaze
and sat himself where he could watch the door.  It
never admitted Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"What's the night?" he asked a seafaring newcomer.
</p>

<p>
"Blowing up," the man told him.  "Blowing up
dirty."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox went from the room and from the
house, shivered as the night air struck him, and then
down the cobbled street.  Ten o'clock, borne gustily
upon the wind, came to him from the church tower as
he turned along the shore.
</p>

<p>
None saw him go: and he was not to return.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0303"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
WATER THAT TAKES YOUR BREATH
</h3>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox's landsman's eye showed him no
signs of that "blowing up dirty" of which he had been
informed.  A fresh breeze faced him as he walked and
somewhat hindered his progress; but a strong moon
rode high and lighted him; the sea, much advanced
since he came that way, broke quietly along the shore.
"Why, it's none so bad a night to be out," thought
Mr. Puddlebox; and there began to change within him the
mood in which he had left the lodging-house.  Seated
there he had imagined a rough night, wet and dark,
and with each passing hour had the more reproached
himself for his desertion of his loony.  Now that he found
night clear and still, well-lit and nothing overcold, he
inclined towards considering himself a fool for his
pains.
</p>

<p>
An hour on his road brought change of mood again.
The very stillness, the very clearness that first had
reassured him, now began to frighten him.  He began to
apprehend as it were a something sinister in the quietude.
He began to dislike the persistent regularity of
his footsteps grinding in the deep shingle and to dislike
yet more the persistent regularity of the breaking waves.
They rose about knee-high as he watched them, fell
and pressed whitely up the beach, back slowly, as
though reluctant and with deep protest of the stones,
then massed knee-high and down and up again.  Darkly
on his right hand the steep cliffs towered.
</p>

<p>
The monotony of sound oppressed him.  He began
to have an eerie feeling as though he were being
followed, and once or twice he looked back.  No, very
much alone.  Then his footsteps, whose persistent
regularity had wrought upon his senses, began to trouble
him with their noisiness upon the shingle.  He tried to
walk less heavily and presently found himself picking
his way, and that added to the eeriness, startling him
when the loose stones yielded and he stumbled.
</p>

<p>
He approached that quarter where the shore began
to be divided by the rocky barriers that ran from cliff
to sea.  Then he apprehended what, as he expressed it
to himself, was the matter with the sea.  It was very
full.  It looked very deep.  What had seemed to him to
be waves rolling up now appeared to him as a kind of
overflowing, as though not spurned-out waves, but the
whole volume of the water welled, swelled, to find more
room.  The breaking sound was now scarcely to be
heard, and that intensified the stillness, and that
frightened him more.  He began to run....
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox stopped running for want of breath;
but that physical admission of the mounting panic
within him left him very frightened indeed.  He went
close to the cliffs.  Darker there and very shut-up the
way they towered so straight and so high.  He came
away from them, his senses worse wrought upon.  Then
he came to the first of the rocky barriers that ran like
piers from the cliff to the sea, and then for the first time
noticed how high the tide had risen.  When he came
here with Mr. Wriford they had done their climbing
far from the cliff's base.  Now the barrier was in great
part submerged.  He must climb it near to the cliff
where climbing was steeper and more difficult.  Well,
there was sand between these barriers, that was one
good thing.  Walking would be easier and none of that
cursed noise that his feet made on the shingle.  With
much difficulty he got up and looked down upon the
other side....
</p>

<p>
There wasn't any sand.  Water where sand had been&mdash;water
that with that welling, swelling motion pressed
about the shingle that banked beneath the cliff.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox said aloud, in a whisper: "The tide!"
It was the first time since he had started out that he
had thought of it.  He looked along the cliff.  From
where he stood, from where these rocky piers began, the
cliff, as he saw, began to stand outwards in a long bluff.
The further one went, the further the tide would....
He carried his eyes a little to sea.  Beneath the moon
were white, uneasy lines.  That was where the sea
swirled upon the barriers.  He looked downwards and
saw the placid water welling, swelling beneath his
feet.
</p>

<p>
"The tide," said Mr. Puddlebox again, again in a
whisper.  He swallowed something that rose in his
throat.  He ran his tongue around his lips, for they were
dry.  He shivered, for the perspiration his long walk
had induced now seemed to be running down his body
in very cold drops.  He looked straight above him and
at once down to his feet again and moved his feet in
steadying of his balance: a sense of giddiness came
from looking up that towering height that towered so
steeply as to appear hanging over him.  He looked
along the way he had come; and he stood so close to the
cliff-face, and it bulked so enormously before him, that
the bay he had traversed seemed, by contrast, to sweep
back immensely far&mdash;immensely safe.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox watched that safety with unmoving
eyes as though he were fascinated by it.  The longer
he watched the more it seemed to draw him.  He kept
his eyes upon one distant spot, half way along the bay
and high up the shore, and his hypnotic state presented
him to himself sitting there&mdash;safe.  Still with his
eyes upon it he moved across the narrow pier in its
direction and sat down, legs dangling towards the bay,
in the first action of descending.  He twisted about to
pursue the action, for he was a timid and unhandy
climber who would climb downwards facing his hold.
As he came to his hands and knees he went forward on
them and looked across the fifty yards of shingle-bank,
the sea close up, that separated him from the next pier
of rocks.  He was a creature of fear as he knelt there&mdash;a
very figure of very ugly fear, ungainly in his form that
hung bulkily between his arms and legs, white and
loosely fat in his face that peered timorously over the
edge, cowardly and useless in his crouching, shrinking
pose.
</p>

<p>
He said aloud, his eyes on the distant barrier: "I'm
as safe there&mdash;for a peep&mdash;as I am here.  I can get
back.  Even if I get wet I can get back."
</p>

<p>
He shuffled forward and this time put his legs over the
other side and sat a while.  Here the drop was not more
than three feet beneath the soles of his boots as they
dangled.  He drew them up.  "If he's safe, he's safe,"
said Mr. Puddlebox.  "And if he's drowned, he's
drowned.  Where's the sense of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Something that floated in the water caught his eye.
A little, round, greyish clump.  About the size of a face.
Floating close to the shore.  Not a face.  A clump of
fishing-net corks that Mr. Puddlebox remembered to
have seen dry upon the sand when first he arrived here.
But very like, very dreadfully like a face, and the water
rippling very dreadfully over it at each pulsing of the
tide.  Floated his loony's face somewhere like that?
Struggled he somewhere near to shore as that?  The
ripples awash upon his mouth?  His eyes staring?
Mouth that had laughed with Mr. Puddlebox these
several months?  Eyes that often in appeal had sought
his own, and that he loved to light from fear to peace,
to trust, to confidence, to merriment?  Floated he
somewhere?  Struggled he somewhere?  Waited he
somewhere for these hands which, when he sometimes
caught, proved them at last of use to some one, stronger
than some one else's in many years of sin?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox slid to the shingle and ran along it;
came to the further barrier and got upon it; stood there
in fear.  Beyond, and to the next pier, there was no
more, between sea and cliff, than room to walk.
</p>

<p>
His lips had been very dry when, a short space before,
looking towards where now he stood, he had run his
tongue around them.  They were moist then to what,
licking them again, his tongue now felt.  Cold the
sweat then that trickled down his body: warm to what
icy stream fear now exuded on his flesh.  He had
shivered then: now he not shivered but in all his frame
shook so that his knees scarcely could support him.
Then it was merely safety that he desired: now he
realised fear.  Then only safety occupied his mind: now
cowardice within him, and he knew it.  Love, strangely,
strongly conceived in these months, called him on:
fear, like a live thing on the rock before him, held him,
pressed him back.  He thought of rippling water awash
upon that mouth, and looked along the narrow path
before him, and licked his arid lips again: he saw
himself with that deep water, that icy water, that thick
water, welling, swelling, to his knees, to his waist, to his
neck, sucking him adrift&mdash;ah! and he looked back
whence he had come and ran his tongue again about his
ugly, hanging mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a coward," said Mr. Puddlebox aloud.  "I
can't come to you, boy," he said.  "I've got to go back,
boy," he said.  "I can't stand the water, boy.  I've
always been terrified of deep water, boy.  I'd come to
you through fire, boy; by God, I would.  Not through
water.  I'm a coward.  I can't help it, boy.  Water
takes your breath.  I can't do it, boy."
</p>

<p>
He waited as if he thought an answer would come.
There was only an intense stillness.  There was only the
very tiniest lapping of the water as it welled and swelled:
sometimes there was the faint rattle of a stone that the
sucking water sucked from the little ridge of pebbles
against the cliff.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox looked down upon the water and
spoke to it.  The words he spoke might have been
employed fiercely, but he spoke them scarcely above a
whisper as though it were a confidence that he invited
of the sea.  "Why don't you break and roar?" said
Mr. Puddlebox to the sea, bending down to it.  "Why
don't you break and roar in waves with foam?  You'd
be more like fire then.  There'd be something in you
then.  It's the dead look of you.  It's the thick look of
you.  Why don't you break and roar?  It's the swelling
up from under of you.  It's the sucking of you.  Why
don't you break and roar?"
</p>

<p>
No answer to that.  Only the aching stillness.  Only
the very tiniest, tiniest lapping of the water as it welled
and swelled: sometimes the tiny rattle of a stone that
from the ridge against the cliff the sucking water sucked.
</p>

<p>
In that silence Mr. Puddlebox continued to stare at
the water.  He stared at it; and at its silence, and as
he stared, and as silent, motionless, he continued to
stare, his face began to work as, in the presence of a
sleeper, sudden stealthy resolve might come to one
that watched.  Then he began to act as though the
water were in fact asleep.  He looked all round, then
he stepped swiftly down to the little ridge.  The
pebbles gave beneath him and carried his left foot into
the water.  He stood perfectly still, pressed against the
cliff.  "Why don't you break and roar?" whispered
Mr. Puddlebox.  No answer.  No sound.  He began to
tread very cautiously towards the further pier, the
palms of his hands against the cliff, and his face
anxiously towards the sea, and all his action as though
he moved in stealth and thought to give the sea the
slip.  As he neared the barrier, so neared the cliff the
sea.  When but twenty yards remained to be traversed
the cliff began to thrust a buttress seaward, awash
along its base.  "Water takes your breath," Mr. Puddlebox
had said.  A dozen steps took him above his boots,
and he began to catch at his breath as the chill struck
him.  He opened his mouth with the intent to make
these sobbing inspirations less noisy than if drawn
hissing through his teeth.  He slid his feet as if to lift
and splash them would risk awakening the sleeping tide.
He was to his knees in it when he reached the rocks.
Their surface was green in slimy weed: that meant the
tide would cover them.  He got up, and on his hands
and knees upon the slime caught at his breath and
peered beyond.
</p>

<p>
No beach was visible here: only water: perfectly
still.
</p>

<p>
It was a very short way to the next barrier, and of
the barrier very short what was to be seen.  The buttress
of the cliff pressed steadily out to what was no more
than a little table of rock, scarcely thicker above the
surface than the thickness of a table-top, then seemed
to fall away.  A trifle beyond the table there upstood a
detached pile of rock, rather like a pulpit and standing
about a pulpit's height above the water.  That table&mdash;when
it ran far out along the shore&mdash;was where Mr. Puddlebox,
looking back, had last seen his loony stand.
He remembered it, for he remembered the summit of
the pulpit rock that peered above it.
</p>

<p>
The idea to shout occurred to him.  That low table
seemed to mark a corner.  His loony might be beyond
it.  If he shouted&mdash;  He did not dare to shout.  Here,
more than before, the intensity of the silence possessed
him.  He did not dare to break it.  Here, with no beach
visible, the water seemed profoundly dead in slumber.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you break and roar?" said Mr. Puddlebox.
"Why don't you&mdash;" he held his breath and
crept forward.  He lowered himself and caught his
breath.  His feet crunched upon the shingle bed, the
water stood above his knees, and while the stones still
moved where he had disturbed them he stood perfectly
still.  When they had settled he began to move,
sideways, very slowly, his back against the cliff.  Each
sidelong step took him deeper; at each he more sharply
caught his breath.  It seemed to him as though the cliff
were actually pressing him forward with huge hands.
He pressed against it with all his force as though to hold
it back.  It thrust him, thrust him, thrust him.  He
was deep to his thighs.  He was deep to his waist.
"Water takes your breath," Mr. Puddlebox had said.
At each deepening step more violently his breath
seemed to be taken, more clutchingly had to be
recalled.  He was above his waist.  He stumbled and
gave a cry and recovered himself and began to go back;
tried to control his dreadful breathing; came on again;
then again retreated.  Now his breathing that had been
sobbing gasps became sheer sobs.  He suddenly turned
from his sidelong progress, went backwards in two
splashing strides whence he had come&mdash;in three, in
four, and then in a panic headlong rush, and as if he
were pursued clambered frantically out again upon
the slimy rocks.
</p>

<p>
As if he were pursued&mdash;and now, as if to sight the
pursuit, looked sobbing back upon the water he had
churned.  There was scarcely a sign of his churning.
Scarcely a mark of his track.  Still as before the water
lay there.  Still, and thick, and silent, and asleep, and
seemed to mock his fears.
</p>

<p>
"Blast you!" cried Mr. Puddlebox, responsive to
the silent mock.  "Blast you, why don't you break
and roar?"  He put a foot down to it and glared at the
water.  "Why in hell don't you break and roar?" cried
Mr. Puddlebox, and flung himself in again, and splashed
to the point at which he had turned and fled, and drew
a deep breath and went forward above his waist....
</p>

<p>
The cliff thrust him out and he was deeper; thrust
again, and he was above his waist.  "Takes your
breath"&mdash;he was catching at his breath in immense
spasms.  The shore dropped beneath his feet and he was
to his armpits, the table of rock a long pace away.  He
was drawn from the cliff, and he screamed in dreadful
fear.  He tried to go back and floundered deeper.  He
was drowning, he knew.  If he lost his footing&mdash;and
he was losing it&mdash;he would go down, and if he went
down he never would rise again.  He called aloud on
God and screamed aloud in wordless terror.  The tide
swung him against the cliff and drew him screaming and
clutching along it.  He stumbled and knew himself
gone.  His hands struck the table of rock.  He clutched,
found his feet, sprang frantically, and drew himself
upon it.  He lay there exhausted and moaning.  When
his abject mind was able to give words to his moans,
"O my Christ, don't let me drown," he said.  "Not
after that, Christ, don't let me drown.  O merciful
Christ, not after that."
</p>

<p>
After a little he opened his eyes that had been shut
in bewilderment of blind terror and in preparation of
death and that he had not courage or thought to open.
He opened his eyes.  This is what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Beneath his chin, as he lay, the still, deep water.
Close upon his right hand the cliff that towered upwards
to the night.  A narrow channel away from him stood
the pulpit rock.  The cliff ran sharply back from beside
him, then thrust again towards the pulpit; stopped
short of it and then pressed onwards out to sea.  Its
backward dip formed a tiny inlet over which, masking
it from the open sea, the pulpit rock stood sentinel.
The back of the inlet showed at its centre a small cave
that had the appearance of a human mouth, open.  At
low water this mouth would have stood a tall man's
height above the beach.  A short ridge ran along its
upper lip.  In the dim light it showed there blackly
like a little clump of moustache.  From its under lip,
forming a narrow slipway of beach up to it, there ran a
rubble of stones as if the mouth had emitted them or as
if its tongue depended into the sea.  The corners of the
mouth drooped, and here, as if they slobbered, the water
trickled in and out responsive to the heaving of the tide.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford lay upon this slip.  He lay face downwards.
His arms from his elbows were extended within
the mouth of the cave.  His boots were in the water.
His legs, as Mr. Puddlebox thought, lay oddly twisted.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
WATER THAT SWELLS AND SUCKS
</h3>

<p>
Who is so vile a coward that one weaker than himself,
in worse distress, shall not arrest his cowardice?  Who
that has given love so lost in fear as not to love anew,
amain, when out of peril his love is called?  Who so
base then not to lose in gladness what held his soul in
dread?
</p>

<p>
First Mr. Puddlebox only stared.  Water that takes
your breath had taken his.  Water that takes your
breath rose in a thin film over the rock where on his face
he lay, passed beneath his body, chilled him anew, and
took his breath again.  He watched it ooze from under
him and spread before him: lip upwards where he faced
it and ooze beneath his hands.  Then gave his eyes
again towards the cave.
</p>

<p>
Who is so vile a coward?  Mr. Puddlebox's teeth
chattered with his body's frozen chill: worse, worse, with
terror of what he had escaped&mdash;God, when that sucking
water sucked!&mdash;fast, faster with that worse horror he
besought heaven "not after that" should overtake him.
Who so vile, so base?  Ah, then that piteous thing that
lay before his eyes! in shape so odd, so ugly&mdash;broken? dead?
Whom he had seen so wild, so eager? who child
had been to him and treated as a child?  Who first
and only in all these years of sin had looked to him for
aid, for counsel, strength?  Who must have fought this
filthy, cruel, silent, sucking water, and fighting it have
called him, wanted him?  Ah!
</p>

<p>
Who is so vile?  "Loony," Mr. Puddlebox whispered.
"Loony!  Hey, boy!"
</p>

<p>
He only whispered.  He did not dare a cry that should
demand an answer&mdash;and demanding, no answer bring.
"Hey, boy!  Loony!"  He tried to raise his voice.  He
dared not raise it.  Anew and thicker now the water
filmed the rock about him.  Here was death: well, there
was death&mdash;that piteous thing....
</p>

<p>
Then change!  Then out of death life!  Then gladness
out of dread!  Then joy's tumult as one beside a form
beneath a sheet should see the dead loved move.
</p>

<p>
About the slipway, as he watched, he saw the swelling
water, as if with sudden impulse, swell over Mr. Wriford's
boots, run to his knees, and in response the prone
figure move&mdash;the shoulders raise as if to drag the
body: raise very feebly and very feebly drop as if the
oddly twisted legs were chained.
</p>

<p>
Feebly&mdash;ah, but in sign of life!  Revulsion from fear
to gladness brought Mr. Puddlebox scrambling to his
feet and upright upon them.  To a loud cry there would
be answer then!  Loudly he challenged it.  "Loony!"
cried Mr. Puddlebox, his voice athrill.  "Hey, boy,
what's wrong?  I'm coming to you, boy!"
</p>

<p>
It was a groan that answered him.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hurt, boy?"
</p>

<p>
There answered him: "Oh, for God's sake&mdash;oh, for
God's sake!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's my loony!" cried Mr. Puddlebox in a
very loud voice.  "Hold on, boy!  I'm coming to you!"
</p>

<p>
Excitedly, in excited gladness his terrors bound up,
quickly as he could, catching at his breath as his fears
caught him, stifling them in jolly shouts of: "Hold on
for me, boy!  Why, here I come, boy, this very minute!"
he started to make his way, excitedly pursued it.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on for me, boy!"  The cliff along the wall of
the inlet against which he stood shelved downwards
into the dark, still sea.  "Here I come, boy!"  He went
on his face on the table rock and with his legs felt in the
water beneath him and behind him.  "Hold on for me,
boy!"  His feet found a ridge, and he lowered himself
to it and began to feel his way along it, his hands against
the cliff, above his waist the still, dark sea.  "Here I
come, boy!  This very minute!"
</p>

<p>
So he cried: so he came&mdash;deeper, and now his perils
rose to fight what brought him on.  Deeper&mdash;the
water took his breath.  "Here I come, boy!"  Stumbled&mdash;thought
himself gone, knew as it were an icy hand
thrust in his vitals from the depths, clutching his very
heart.  "I'm to you now, boy.  Here&mdash;"  Terror
burst in a cry to his mouth.  He changed it to "Whoa!"  He
was brought by the ridge on which he walked to a
point opposite what of the slipway before the cave
stood dry.  The ridge ended abruptly.  He had almost
gone beyond it, almost slipped and gone, almost
screamed.
</p>

<p>
"Whoa!" said Mr. Puddlebox.  "Hold on for me,
boy!"  He took his hands from the cliff and faced about
where Mr. Wriford lay.  Shaken, he felt his way lower.
God, again!  Again his foothold terminated!  Abruptly
he could feel his way no more.  Like a hand, like a hand
at his throat, the water caught his breath.  "Hold on
for me, boy!"  His voice was thick.  "Hold on for me,
boy!"  Clear again, but he stood, stood, and where he
stood the water swayed him.  Here the cliff base seemed
to drop.  Here the depths waited him.  Facing his feet
he knew must be the wall of the slipway.  No more than
a long stride&mdash;ah, no more!  If he launched himself
and threw himself, his foot must strike it, his arms come
upon its surface where that figure lay.  Only a long
stride.  What, when he made it, if no foothold offered?
What if he missed, clutched, fell?  He looked across the
narrow space.  Only that spring's distance that figure
lay, its face turned from him.  He listened.  The silence
ached, tingled all about him.  Suddenly it gave him
from the figure the sound of breathing that came and
went in moans.
</p>

<p>
Who is so vile a coward?  Swiftly Mr. Puddlebox
crouched, nerved, braced himself to spring.  Ah, swifter
thrust his mind, and bright as flame and fierce as flame,
as a flame shouting, flamed flaming vision before his
starting eyes.  He saw himself leap.  He saw himself
clutch, falling&mdash;God, he could feel his finger-nails rasp
and split!&mdash;fallen, gone: rising to gulp and scream,
sinking to suffocate and gulp and writhe and rise and
scream and gulp and sink and go.  Like flame, like
flame, the vision leapt&mdash;upstreaming from the water,
shouting in his ears.  Thrice he crouched to spring; thrice
like flame the vision thundered: thrice passed as flame
that bursts before the wind: thrice left him to the
stillness, the sucking water, the sound of moaning breath.
A fourth time, a last time: ah, now was gone the very
will to bring himself to crouch!
</p>

<p>
He stood a moment, vacant, only trembling.  His
senses fluttered back to him, and gone, so they
informed him, something that before their flight had
occupied them.  What?  In his shaken state he was
again a vacant space searching for it before he
realised.  Then he knew.  There was no sound of
breathing....
</p>

<p>
Trembling he listened for it, staring at the figure.
Still; there was no sound.  Suddenly he heard it.
Dreadfully it came.  Feebly, a moaning inspiration:
stillness again&mdash;then a very little sigh, very gentle,
very tiny, and the prone figure quivered, relaxed.
</p>

<p>
Dead?  Again, as on the table rock, afraid to call
aloud, "Loony!" Mr. Puddlebox whispered.  "Hey,
boy!"
</p>

<p>
No answer.  Swelling about him came the creeping
water, swayed him, swelled and swayed again: high
to his chest, higher now and moving him&mdash;moving,
sucking, drawing.  Here was death: ah, well, wait a
moment, for there was death&mdash;that piteous thing face
downwards there.  He spoke softly: "Hey, boy, are
you gone?"  The water rocked him.  He cried brokenly,
loudly: "Loony!  Are you gone, boy?"
</p>

<p>
Again, again, life out of death, joy's tumult out of
fear!
</p>

<p>
He saw Mr. Wriford draw down his arms, press on his
elbows, raise, then turn towards him his face, most
dreadfully grey, most dreadfully drawn in pain.
</p>

<p>
Who so vile, so base?
</p>

<p>
Swift, swift revulsion to gladness out of dread.  "Why,
that's my loony!" cried Mr. Puddlebox in a very loud
voice.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said: "Have you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, here I am, boy!"  He steadied his feet.
</p>

<p>
Very feebly, scarcely to be heard: "I don't see you."
</p>

<p>
"Why, there's no more than my nob to be seen,
boy!  I'm here to my nob in the water."  His feet
were firm.  He braced himself.  "I'm to you, boy, and
I'm in the most plaguy place as I challenge any man
ever to have been."  He crouched.  "I've to jump, boy,
and how to the devil&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He launched himself.  His foot struck the slipway
bank&mdash;no hold!  Smooth rock, and his foot glanced
down it!  He had thought to spring upward from what
purchase his foot might find.  It found none.  Clutching
as he fell, he obtained no more than his arms upon
the shingle of the slipway, his chin upon it, his elbows
thrusting deep, his fingers clutching in the yielding
stones.
</p>

<p>
"Loony!" Mr. Puddlebox cried.  "Loony!"
</p>

<p>
He slipped further.  He suddenly screamed: "Loony,
I'm going!  Christ, I'm going!"
</p>

<p>
His face, in line with Mr. Wriford's, two arm's-lengths
from it, was dreadfully distorted, his lips wide, his
teeth grinding.  He choked between them: "Can you
help me, boy?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford was trying to help him.  Mr. Wriford
was working towards him on his elbows, his face twisted
in agony.  As he came, "My legs are broken," he said.
"I'll reach you.  I'll reach you."
</p>

<p>
Eye to eye and dreadfully eyed they stared one upon
the other.  A foot's breadth between them now, and now
their fingers almost touching.
</p>

<p>
"I'm done, boy!  Christ, I'm done!"  But with the
very cry, and with his hand so near to Mr. Wriford's
slipped again beyond it, Mr. Puddlebox had sudden
change of voice, sudden gleam in the eyes that had
stood out in horror.  "Curse me, I'm not!" cried
Mr. Puddlebox.  "Curse me, I've bested it.  I've found a
hole for my foot.  Ease up, boy.  I'm to you.  By God,
I'm to you after all!"
</p>

<p>
Groan that was prayer of thanks came from Mr. Wriford.
Fainting, his head dropped forward on his
hands.  There was tremendous commotion in the water
as Mr. Puddlebox sprang up it from his foothold,
thrashing it with his legs as, chest upon the shingle,
he struggled tremendously.  Then he drew himself out
and on his knees, dripping, and bent over Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"I'm to you now, boy!  You're all right now.  Boy,
you're all right now."
</p>

<p>
The swelling water swelled with new impulse up the
shingle, washed him where he knelt, ran beneath
Mr. Wriford's face, and trickled in the stones beyond it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox looked back upon it over his shoulder.
He could not see the table rock where he had lain.  Only
the pulpit rock upstood, and deep and black the channel
on either hand between it and the walls of their inlet.
He looked within the cave mouth before him and could
see its inner face.  It was no more than a shallow
hollowing by the sea.  He looked upwards and saw the
cliff towering into the night, overhanging as it mounted.
</p>

<p>
He passed his tongue about his lips.

CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
WATER THAT BREAKS AND ROARS
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
In a very little while Mr. Puddlebox had dragged
Mr. Wriford the three paces that gave them the mouth of
the cave and had sat him upright there, his back against
the cliff.  Mr. Wriford had groaned while he was being
moved, now he opened his eyes and looked at
Mr. Puddlebox bending over him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, that's my loony!" cried Mr. Puddlebox very
cheerfully.  The flicker of a smile rewarded him and
from the moment of that smile he concealed, until they
parted, the terrors that consumed him.  "Why, that's
my loony!" cried he, and went on one knee, smiling
confidently in Mr. Wriford's face.  "What's happened
to you, boy?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said weakly: "I've broken my legs.  I
think both my legs are broken."  He indicated the
pulpit rock with a motion of his head.  "I climbed up
there.  Then I thought I'd jump down.  Very high and
rocky underneath, but I thought of it, and so I did it.
I didn't land properly.  I twisted my legs."
</p>

<p>
He groaned and closed his eyes.  "Well, well," said
Mr. Puddlebox, holding his hands and patting them.
"There, boy, there.  You're all right now.  I'm to you
now, boy."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I fainted," Mr. Wriford said.  "I found
it was night and the tide up to my feet.  I began to drag
myself.  I dragged myself up and up, and the tide
followed.  Is it still coming?"
</p>

<p>
"You're all right now, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox.
"Boy, you're all right now."
</p>

<p>
He felt a faint pressure from Mr. Wriford's hands
that he held; he saw in Mr. Wriford's eyes the same
message that the pressure communicated.  He twisted
sharply on his heels, turning with a fierce and
threatening motion upon the water as one hemmed in by
ever-bolder wolves might turn to drive them back.
</p>

<p>
From where he knelt the water was almost to be
touched.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox got to his feet and stooped and peered
within the cave.  The moon silvered a patch of its inner
face.  It gleamed wetly.  He looked to its roof.  Water
dripped upon his upturned face.  The cave would fill,
when the tide was full.  He caught his breath as he
realised that, looked out upon the dark, still sea, and
caught his breath again.  He stepped out backwards
till his feet were in the water and looked up the towering
cliff.  It made him sick and dizzy, and he staggered a
splashing step, then looked again.  To the line of the
indentation that had seemed like a clump of moustache
upon the cave's upper lip, the cliff on either hand
showed dark.  Above that line its slaty hue was
lighter.
</p>

<p>
That was high-water mark.
</p>

<p>
He went a step forward and stood on tiptoe.  The
tips of his fingers could just reach the narrow
indentation&mdash;just the tips of his fingers: and sick again he
went and dizzy and came down to his heels and turned
and stared upon the dark, still sea.
</p>

<p>
Then he went to Mr. Wriford again and crouched
beside him: took his hands and patted them and
smiled at him, but did not speak.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford spoke.  He said tonelessly: "Are we
going to drown?"
</p>

<p>
"Drown?" cried Mr. Puddlebox in a very loud voice.
"Why, boy, what to the devil has drowning got to do
with it?  Drown!  I was just thinking, that's all.  I was
thinking of my supper&mdash;pork and onions, boy; and
when to the devil I shall have had enough, once I get
to it, I challenge you to say or any other man.  Drown,
boy!  Why, these poor twisted legs of yours have got
into your head to think of such a thing!  You can't be
thinking this bit of a splash is going to drown us?  Why,
listen to this, boy&mdash;" and with that Mr. Puddlebox
turned to the sea and stretching an arm towards it
trolled in a very deep voice:
</p>

<p>
"O ye sea of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise Him
and magnify Him for ever!
</p>

<p>
"That's all that bit of a splash is going to do," said
Mr. Puddlebox very cheerfully; "going to praise the
Lord and going to damp our boots if we let it, which,
curse me, we won't.  All we've got to think about is
where we're going to sit till the water goes back where,
curse me, it should always be instead of shoving itself
up here.  One place is as good as another, boy, and
there's plenty of them, but I know the best.  Now I'm
going to shift you back a bit, loony," Mr. Puddlebox
continued, standing upright, "and then we're going to
sit together a half-hour or so, and then I'm going to
have my pork and onions, and you're going to be
carried to bed."
</p>

<p>
Very tenderly Mr. Puddlebox drew Mr. Wriford back
within the cave.  "Now you watch me," said Mr. Puddlebox,
"because for once in your life I'm the one
that's going to do things while you look on.  There's
only a pair of good legs between us, boy, and that's
ample for two of us, but, curse me, they're mine, and
I'm going to do what I want with them."
</p>

<p>
While in jolly accents he spoke thus Mr. Puddlebox
was dislodging from the floor of the cave large stones
that lay embedded in the shingle and piling them
beneath the indentation that showed upon the cave's
upper lip.  He sang as he worked.  Sometimes "O ye
sea" as he had trolled before; sometimes "O ye stones;"
sometimes, as he tugged at a larger boulder&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"O ye fearful weights, bless ye the Lord: praise Him
and magnify Him for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Always with each variation he turned a jolly face to
Mr. Wriford; always he turned from Mr. Wriford
towards the sea that now had reached the pedestal he
was building a face that was grey, that twitched in fear.
</p>

<p>
"O ye whacking great stones, bless ye the Lord:
praise Him and magnify Him for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Knee-high he built his pedestal, working furiously
though striving to conceal his haste.  Now he stood in
water as he strengthened the pile.  Now the water had
swelled past it and swelled to Mr. Wriford's outstretched
feet.  Now Mr. Puddlebox climbed upon the mound of
stones and brought his head above the narrow indentation
above the cave.  It showed itself to be a little ledge.
He thrust an arm upon it and found it as broad as the
length of his forearm, narrowing as it went back to end
in a niche that ran a short way up the cliff.  There was
room for one to sit there, legs hanging down; perhaps
for two&mdash;if two could gain it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox dropped back to the water and now
dragged last stones that should make a step to his pile.
Then he went to Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox very cheerfully.
"Now I've got the cosiest little seat for you, and now
for you to get to it.  You can't stand?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't," Mr. Wriford said.
</p>

<p>
"Try if I can prop you against the cliff."
</p>

<p>
He took Mr. Wriford beneath the arms and began to
raise him.  Mr. Wriford implored: "Don't hurt me!"
and as he was raised from the ground screamed
dreadfully.  "Oh, God!  Oh, God, don't, don't;" and
when set down again lay feebly moaning: "Don't!
Don't!"
</p>

<p>
There immediately began the most dreadful business.
</p>

<p>
"Boy," said Mr. Puddlebox, "I've got to hurt you.
I'll be gentle as I can, my loony.  Boy, you've got to
bear it."  He abandoned his pretence of their safety,
and for his jolly humour that had supported it, permitted
voice and speech that denied it and revealed the stress
of their position.  "Boy, the tide is making on us.  It's
to fill this cave, boy, before it turns.  There's slow
drowning waiting for us unless I lift you where I've found
a place."
</p>

<p>
"Let me drown!" Mr. Wriford said.  "Oh, let me drown."
</p>

<p>
The sea drove in and washed the cave on every side.
Involuntarily Mr. Wriford cried out in fear and stretched
his arms to Mr. Puddlebox, bending above him.
</p>

<p>
"Come, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox and took him
again beneath the arms: again as he was moved he
cried: "Don't!  Don't!"
</p>

<p>
"Boy," cried Mr. Puddlebox fiercely, "will you
watch me drown before your eyes?"
</p>

<p>
"Save yourself then.  Save yourself."
</p>

<p>
"By God Almighty I will not.  If you won't let me
lift you you shall drown me."
</p>

<p>
Then determinedly he passed his hands beneath Mr. Wriford's
arms; then resolutely shut his ears to dreadful
cries of pain; then, then the dreadful business.  "Boy,
I've got to hurt you.  I'll be gentle, my loony.  Bear
it, boy, oh, for Christ's sake bear it.  Round my neck,
boy.  Hold tight.  Bear it, boy; bear it."
</p>

<p>
He carried his arms round Mr. Wriford's back,
downwards and beneath his thighs and locked them there.
There were dreadful screams; but dreadfully the water
swelled about them, and he held on; there were moans
that rent him as they sounded; but he spoke: "Bear it,
boy; bear it!" and with his burden waded forth.
</p>

<p>
He faced from the sea and towards the pedestal he
had built.
</p>

<p>
"Loony!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for God's sake, set me down."
</p>

<p>
"Now I've to raise you."
</p>

<p>
He began to press upwards with his arms, raising his
burden high on his chest.
</p>

<p>
"Wade out and drown me," Mr. Wriford cried.  "If
you've any mercy, for God's sake drown me!"
</p>

<p>
"You're to obey me, boy.  By God, you shall obey
me, or I'll hurt you worse.  Catch in my hair.  Hold
yourself up by my hair.  High as you can.  Up, up!"
</p>

<p>
He staggered upon the steps he had constructed; he
gained the pedestal he had made.  He thought the
strain had become insupportable to him and that he
must fall with it.  "Now when I lift you, boy, keep
yourself up.  I'll bring you to my head and then set
you back."  He called upon himself supremely&mdash;raised
and failed, raised and failed again.  "Now, boy, now!"
</p>

<p>
He got Mr. Wriford to the ledge and thrust him back;
himself he clung to the ledge and almost senseless
swayed between his hands and feet.
</p>

<p>
Presently he looked up.  "You're safe now, boy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford watched him with eyes that scarcely
seemed to see: he scarcely seemed to be conscious.
</p>

<p>
"I had to speak sharply to you, boy."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford advanced a hand to him, and he took it
and held it.  "There was nothing in what I said, boy."
</p>

<p>
He felt the fingers move in his that covered them.
"I had to cry out," Mr. Wriford said weakly.  "I
couldn't help it."
</p>

<p>
"You were brave, boy, brave.  You're safe now.  The
water will come to you.  But you're safe."
</p>

<p>
"Come up!" said Mr. Wriford.  "Come up!"
</p>

<p>
"I've to rest a moment, boy," Mr. Puddlebox answered him.
</p>

<p>
He held that hand while he stood resting.  He closed
his fingers upon it when presently he spoke again.  Now
the sea had deepened all about, deep to his knees where
he stood.  As if the slipway before the cave while it
stood dry had somehow abated its volume, it seemed to
rise visibly and swiftly now that this last barrier was
submerged.  All about the walls of the inlet deeply and
darkly it swelled, licking the walls and running up them
in little wavelets, as beasts of prey, massed in a cage,
massing and leaping against the bars.
</p>

<p>
"There's no great room for me beside you, boy," Mr.
Puddlebox said and pressed the fingers that he held.
</p>

<p>
"Come up," said Mr. Wriford.  "Quickly&mdash;quickly!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Puddlebox looked at the narrow ledge and turned
his head this way and that and looked again upon the
sea.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Now, while he looked and while still he waited, the
sea's appearance changed.  A wind drove in from
seaward and whipped its placid surface.  Black it had
been, save where the high moon silvered it; grey as it
flickered and as it swelled about the cliff it seemed to
go.  It had welled and swelled; now, from either side
the pulpit rock that guarded their inlet, it drove in in
steeply heaving mass that flung within the cave and all
along the cliff and that the cave and cliff flung back.
It were as if one with a whip packed this full cage fuller
yet, and as though those caged within it leapt here and
there and snapped the air with flashing teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll try for it, boy," said Mr. Puddlebox.
"These stones are shaking under me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford withdrew his hand and with his hands
painfully raised himself a little to one side.  The action
removed his back from the crevice up the cliff face in
which it had rested.  A growth of hardy scrub clung
here, and Mr. Puddlebox thrust forward his hand and
pulled on it.
</p>

<p>
"Now I'll try for it, boy," he said again.  He looked
up into Mr. Wriford's face.  "There's nothing to talk
about twixt you and me, loony," he said.  "We've had
some rare days since you came down the road to me,
boy.  If this bush comes away in my hand and I slip
and go, why there's an end to it, boy, and as well one
way as another.  Don't you be scared."
</p>

<p>
"I shall hold you," Mr. Wriford said.  Intensity
filled out and strengthened his weak voice.  "I shall
hold you.  I'll never let you go."
</p>

<p>
There began some protest out of Mr. Puddlebox's
mouth.  It was not articulated when the rising sea
mastered at last the stones beneath his feet; drove from
him again his courage; returned him again his panic
fear; and he cried out, and swiftly crouched and sprang.
He achieved almost his waist to the level of the ledge.
He swept up his other hand to the scrub in the crevice
and fastened a double grip within it.  It was hold or
go, but the scrub held and his peril that he must hold
or go gave him immense activity.  He drew himself and
forced himself.  His knee nearer to Mr. Wriford came
almost upon the ledge, and Mr. Wriford caught at the
limb and gripped it as with claws.  "Your other
knee!" Mr. Wriford cried.  "Higher!  For God's sake
a little higher!"
</p>

<p>
The further knee struck the ledge wide out where it
no more than showed upon the cliff.
</p>

<p>
"Higher!  Higher!"
</p>

<p>
Horribly from Mr. Puddlebox, as from one squeezed
in the throat and in death straining a last word: "Hold
me!  Hold me, boy!  Don't let me drown in that
water!"
</p>

<p>
"Higher!  Higher!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't let me drown&mdash;don't let me drown in that
water!"
</p>

<p>
"Higher!  An inch&mdash;an inch higher."
</p>

<p>
The inch was gained.  "Now!  Now!"
</p>

<p>
The knee dug into the very rock upon its inch of hold,
Mr. Puddlebox clutched higher in the scrub, drew up
his other leg, drew in his knees and knelt against the
cliff.
</p>

<p>
Unstrung, and breathing in spasmodic clutches of his
chest, he remained a space in that position, and
Mr. Wriford collapsed and in new pain leant back where he
sat.  Presently, and very precariously, Mr. Puddlebox
began to twist about and lowered himself to sit upon the
ledge.  The crevice where the ledge was broadest was
between them.  Mr. Puddlebox with his left hand held
himself in his seat by the scrub that filled this niche,
and when Mr. Wriford smiled weakly at him and
weakly murmured, "Safe now," he replied: "There's
very little room, boy," and looked anxiously upon the
sea that now in angry waves was mounting to them.
He looked from there to the dark line on either hand
that marked the height of the tide's run.  The line was
level with his waist as he sat.  He looked at Mr. Wriford
and saw how narrow his perch, and down to the sea
again.  He said to himself: "That's four times I've
been a dirty coward."  He said in excuse: "Takes your
breath," and caught his breath and looked upon the sea.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Now was full evidence, and evidence increasing, of
that "blowing up dirty" of which he had been informed,
and which the stillness of the swelling water had seemed
to falsify.  "Why don't you break and roar?" Mr. Puddlebox
had asked the sea.  White and loud it broke
along the cliff, snatching up to them, falling away as
beasts that crouch to spring, then up and higher and
snatching them again.  The moon, as if her watch was
up, withdrew in clouds and only sometimes peered.
The wind, as if he now took charge, came strongly
and strongly called the sea.  The sea, as if the moon
released it, broke from her stilly bonds and gave itself
to vicious play.  Strongly it rose.  It reached their
hanging feet.  Stronger yet as night drew on, and now
set towards the corner of the inlet nearer to Mr. Wriford's
side and there, repulsed, washed up, and there,
upspringing, washed in a widening motion towards their
ledge.
</p>

<p>
They sat and waited, rarely with speech.
</p>

<p>
At long intervals Mr. Puddlebox would say: "Boy!"
</p>

<p>
No more than a moan would answer him.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, boy."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Quite suddenly the water came.  Without premonitory
splash or leap of spray, quite suddenly, and strongly,
deeply, that widening motion where the sea leapt in
its corner came like a great hand sweeping high and
washed the ledge from end to end&mdash;like a hand sweeping
and, of its suddenness and volume, raised and swept
and shook them where they sat.
</p>

<p>
At this its first coming, neither spoke of it.  There
was only a gasp from each as each was shaken.  It did
not seem to be returning.
</p>

<p>
After a space, "Boy!" said Mr. Puddlebox again.
</p>

<p>
"Well? ... well?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, boy."
</p>

<p>
He clung with his left hand to the scrub.  He brought
over his right and rested it upon Mr. Wriford's that
held the ledge.  "Is the pain bad, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm past pain.  I don't feel my legs at all."
</p>

<p>
"Cold, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel anything.  I keep dreaming.  I think
it's dreaming."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, boy."
</p>

<p>
Again, and again suddenly, that sweeping movement
swept them&mdash;stronger in force, greater in volume.  It
swept Mr. Wriford towards Mr. Puddlebox.  It almost
dislodged him.  He was pressed back and down by
Mr. Puddlebox's hand, and again the water came.
They were scarcely recovered, and once again it struck
and shook them.
</p>

<p>
Now they sat waiting for its onsets.  Now the gasp
and dreadful struggle while the motion swept and sucked
was scarcely done when on and fierce and fiercer yet
again it came and shook them.
</p>

<p>
Now what happened&mdash;long in the telling&mdash;happened
very quickly.
</p>

<p>
"It's the end&mdash;it's the end," Mr. Wriford sobbed&mdash;his
gasps no more than sobbing as each snatch came.
"God, God, it's the end!"
</p>

<p>
"Hell to the end!" cried Mr. Puddlebox fiercely and
fiercely holding him.  "Loony, there's nothing here to
end us!  Boy, do you mind that coastguard we passed
early back?  He walks here soon after daybreak, he
told us, when this bloody tide is down.  He'll help me
carry you down.  Boy, with your back in this niche
here you're safe though the sea washes ever so.  I'm
going to leave you to it.  Wedge in, boy."
</p>

<p>
He began to sidle away.
</p>

<p>
Fiercely the sweeping movement struck them, stopping
Mr. Wriford's protest, driving him to the ledge's
centre, all but carrying Mr. Puddlebox whence he clung.
</p>

<p>
He thrust Mr. Wriford against the niche and roughly
tore his hand from Mr. Wriford's grasp.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" Mr. Wriford cried.  "Giving
me your place&mdash;no, no&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
Fiercely was answered: "Hell to giving my place!
Not me, curse me!  I'm going for safety, boy."  He
indicated the pulpit rock whose surface dryly upstood
before them.  "Easy to get on there.  I'm going to
swim there."
</p>

<p>
"You can't swim!  No&mdash;you shall not&mdash;no!"
</p>

<p>
Again the beat of rushing water.  Scarcely seated
where he had edged, Mr. Puddlebox was dragged away,
clung, and was left upon the ledge's last extremity.  As
glad and radiant as ever it had been, the old jolly beam
came to his face, to his mouth the old jolly words.
"Swim!  Why, boy, I'd swim that rotten far with my
hands tied.  Curse me, I'd never go if I couldn't.  Swim!
Why, curse me, I will swim you or any man, and I
challenge any to the devil to best me at it.  Wedge back,
boy.  Wedge back."
</p>

<p>
He turned away his jolly face, and to the waiting
water turned a face drawn and horrible in fear.
</p>

<p>
Water that takes your breath!
</p>

<p>
He swung himself forward on his hands and dropped.
He drowned instantly.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
There had been no pretence of swimming.  There
seemed to be no struggle.  In one moment he had been
balancing between his hands in seated posture on the
ledge.  In the next down and swallowed up and gone.
</p>

<p>
Eyes that looked to see him rise and swim stared,
stared where he was gone and whence he came not:
then saw his body rise&mdash;all lumped up, the back of its
shoulders, not its head.  Then watched it, all lumped
up, slightly below the surface, bobbed tossing round
the cliff within the inlet: out of sight in the further
corner: now bumping along the further wall: now
submerged and out of view.  Now washed against the
pulpit rock: now a long space bumping about it: now
drawn beyond it: gone.

CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
KINDNESS WITHOUT GRATITUDE
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
In the place where Mr. Wriford next found himself
he first heard the reverberant thunder of the sea.  He
realised with sudden terror that he was not holding on;
and as one starting out of bad dreams&mdash;but he had no
dreams&mdash;in sudden terror he clutched with both his
hands.  That which his hands clutched folded soft and
warm within their grasp, and then he heard a pleasant
voice say:
</p>

<p>
"Why, there you are!  You've kept us waiting a long
time, you know!"
</p>

<p>
He found he was in a bed.  A man, and two women
who wore white aprons and caps and nice blue dresses,
stood at its foot and were smiling at him.  The sun was
shining on their faces, and it was through windows
behind him that the sound of the sea came.  While,
very puzzled, he watched these smiling strangers, the
man stepped to him and slipped firm, reassuring fingers
about his wrist where his hand lay clutching the blue
quilt that covered him.
</p>

<p>
"No need to cling on like that, you know," said the
man, disengaging his grasp.  "You're all right now."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford made one or two attempts at speech.
"I don't&mdash;I don't think I&mdash;I don't think&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He checked himself each time.  His voice sounded
so weak and strange that he thought each time to better
it.  He was not successful; and he let it go as it would
with: "I don't think I ought to be here."
</p>

<p>
The women smiled at that, and the man said: "Well,
I don't know where else you should be, I'm sure.  You're
very comfortable here."
</p>

<p>
"You're just in the middle of a nice sleep, you know,"
said one of the women, bending over the bed-rail towards
him.  "I think I should just finish it if I were you."
</p>

<p>
The other one said: "Would you like to hold my hand
again?"
</p>

<p>
"There's an offer for you," said the man.  "I'm
sure I would."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of quiet laughter, and the woman
who had last spoken came to a chair by Mr. Wriford's
side and sat down and took his hand.  He somehow
felt that that was what he had wanted, and he closed
his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Thereafter he often&mdash;for moments as brief as this
first meeting&mdash;saw the three again; and learnt to
smile when he saw them, responsive to the smiles they
always had for him, and became accustomed to their
names of "Doctor" and "Sister" and "Nurse."  It
was "Nurse" who sat beside him and held his hand.
When he awoke&mdash;or whatever these brief glimpses of
these kind strangers were&mdash;he always awoke with
that same startled clutching as when he had first seen
them.  If it was only the warm folding stuff that his
hands felt he would cling on a moment, vacantly terrified.
When Nurse's hand was there he felt all right at
once and learnt to smile a kind of apology.
</p>

<p>
Once&mdash;or one day, he had no consciousness of time&mdash;when
he thus clutched and felt her hand and smiled,
she said: "You shouldn't start like that.  You needn't
now, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know why I do," he told her.
</p>

<p>
She said: "I expect you're thinking of&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Wriford wasn't thinking at all.  He was
only rather vacantly puzzled when he saw his three
kind friends.  Beyond that his mind held neither
thoughts nor dreams.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Thought came suddenly in a very roundabout way.
Nurse had a very childish face.  Her skin was very pink
and white, and her eyes very blue, and there was
something very childish, almost babyish, about her soft
brows and about her rosy mouth.  Her face began to
have a place with Mr. Wriford, not only when he looked
at it, but when he was sleeping.  When he was sleeping,
though, it had a different body, a different dress.  It
thus, in that different guise, was with him when one day
he awoke and saw her bending close over him, smiling
at him.  He said at once, the word coming to him
without any searching for it, without conscious intention
of pronouncing it: "Brida!"
</p>

<p>
She said "What?"  Now thoughts were visibly
struggling in his eyes.  Nurse could see them changing
all the aspect of his face, as though his eyes were a pool
up into which, stirred by that word, thoughts came
streaming as stilly depths are stirred from their
clearness by some fish that darts along their floor and
upward clouds their bed.  She turned her head and
whispered sharply: "Sister!" then back to him and
asked him: "What a pretty name!  Brida, did you
say?"
</p>

<p>
His mind was rushed long past the word that had
awakened it.  First, with that awakening, had come the
moment when first he had spoken it&mdash;"I'm going to
call you Brida!"  St. James's Park; dusk falling; the
rustle of October leaves about their feet; her flower
face redly suffused....  More than that called him.
More!  In this sudden tumult of his brain, these beating
pulses, all these noises, more, more than these demanded
recognition; fiercely some clamour called him on to
emotions that wrapped up these, submerged, enveloped
them.  There had been one in these emotions that
claimed him more than she; there had been fears, pains,
perils in them&mdash;ah, here with a sudden, overwhelming
rush they came!  "Wedge in, boy!  Wedge in!"  He
that had called those words was swinging on his
hands&mdash;hands that had held him!&mdash;was swinging on his
hands above the swirling water&mdash;was down, was
gone!
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford screamed out shockingly: "You couldn't
swim!  You couldn't swim!"
</p>

<p>
Sister was saying: "There, there!  Don't, don't!
You're all right now!  You're all right now!  Look,
Nurse will hold your hand."
</p>

<p>
He stared at her.  He said brokenly: "Let me alone!
Let me alone!"
</p>

<p>
"Shan't Nurse hold your hand?"
</p>

<p>
"Please let me alone."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
He only wanted to be alone&mdash;alone with his thoughts
that now were full and clear returned to him&mdash;alone
with that grotesque figure with that grotesque name
who had come to him through the water and for him had
gone into the water&mdash;and could not swim, could not
swim!
</p>

<p>
He slept and awoke now and lay awake in normal
periods.  He smiled at Nurse and Sister and Doctor but
did not talk.  He only wanted to be alone.  He would
lie through the day for hours together with wide, staring
eyes, submitting passively when some one came to
attend him or to feed him, but never speaking.  He only
wanted to be alone.
</p>

<p>
Strangers came sometimes&mdash;ladies with flowers,
mostly.  He came to recognize them.  They smiled at
him, and he smiled responsively at them.  But never
spoke.  He only wanted to be alone.  When they were
quite strangers&mdash;visitors he had not seen before&mdash;he
always heard Sister bringing them with the same words:
"This is our very interesting patient.  Yes, this is the
private ward.  It is rather nice, isn't it?  Our
interesting patient.  Poor fellow, he&mdash;" and then whispering,
and then Sister at the foot of the bed with some one
who smiled and nodded and said: "Good morning.  I
hope you are better."
</p>

<p>
He never turned his head as the voices announced
approach from somewhere on his left.  He never gave
direct thought either to Sister's familiar words that
brought them or to the whispering that followed.
Voices and persons passed as it were at a very, very
long distance before him.  He only wanted to be alone;
to lie there; to think, to think.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
A morning notable in its early hours for much
uncommon bustle on the part of Sister and Nurse aroused
him at last to consciousness that something was
expected of him and that he must give attention to where
he was and what was going on about him.  Sister and
Nurse, who always wore their cheerful blue cotton
dresses until the afternoon, appeared this morning in
their serge gowns.  Doctor, who was generally in a
tweed suit with cyclist trouser clips at his ankles, came
in a frock-coat and wriggling his hands with the action
of a man unaccustomed to having stiff cuffs about his
wrists.  The blue quilt was exchanged for a white one
with roses down the centre associated with the days
when a harmonium was played somewhere in the building
and when the sound of hymns floated across
Mr. Wriford's thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Visiting Committee Day to-day," Sister told
Mr. Wriford, "and Doctor's going to have a talk with you
when he comes.  I should try and talk, you know.
Isn't there a lot you want to hear about?"
</p>

<p>
This was a question Sister often asked him, but to
which he never responded with more than: "I'd just
like to be alone, Sister."  To-day the unusual bustle and
stir had already shaken the steady vigil of his thoughts,
and he said: "Yes&mdash;yes, thank you, I think I would."
</p>

<p>
Then Doctor in the frock-coat and with the wriggling
hands&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll just have a talk," said Doctor, speaking
to Sister but looking at Mr. Wriford, after the usual
examination and questions.  And when Sister had left
them he sat on the side of the bed and began.  "You've
had a rough passage, you know," said Doctor.  "But
you're going on fine now.  I've just let you be, but I
think you ought to begin to talk a bit now.  You're
feeling pretty fit?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm very strong really," said Mr. Wriford.  "I'm
weak now, but I'm very strong really.  I feel all
right.  I'm sorry I've not said much.  I've been thinking."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Doctor.  "You've been
mending, too, while you've been quiet.  Do you
remember everything?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I remember."
</p>

<p>
"Remember the coastguards finding you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't remember that."
</p>

<p>
Doctor laughed.  "I expect you're further behind-hand
than you think, then.  How long do you think
you've been here?&mdash;nearly two months!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said without emotion: "Two months.
Will you tell me the date, please?"
</p>

<p>
"December&mdash;nearly Christmas.  It's Christmas
next week.  Now look here, what about your friends?
We must send them a happy Christmas from you,
what?"
</p>

<p>
"I've no friends," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"No friends!  None at all?  Come, you must have,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"I've not," said Mr. Wriford.  "Look here, as soon
as I'm well, I'll go away.  That's all I want."
</p>

<p>
Doctor looked puzzled.  "Got a name, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Wriford."
</p>

<p>
"Wriford&mdash;that's funny.  I've just finished reading
again&mdash;you're no relation to the author, I suppose?
Philip Wriford?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford smiled and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Jove, he can write!" said Doctor with inconsequent
enthusiasm.  "Read any of&mdash;?  You're an educated
man, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a working man," said Mr. Wriford.  "No, I
don't read much."
</p>

<p>
Doctor seemed to be thinking for a moment more of
the Wriford who wrote than of the Wriford who lay
here.  Recollecting himself he went on: "How did you
get there&mdash;where the coastguards found you?"
</p>

<p>
"I was tramping&mdash;looking for work.  I got cut off.
Will you tell me, please?  Where is this place?"
</p>

<p>
Doctor told him.  This was Port Rannock&mdash;the
cottage hospital.  The coastguards had found him
wedged up on the cliff and brought him in.  Touch and
go for a very long time while he lay unconscious&mdash;unconscious
nearly a month.  They had mended his legs&mdash;one
broken, the knee of the other sprained&mdash;fever&mdash;"all
sorts of things," said Doctor, smiling.  "But
we've fixed you up now," he ended.  "You're on the
road now all right," and he went on to explain the real
business of this talk and of the Visiting Committee's
intentions when they came.  Mr. Wriford was to be
moved.  "Only a Cottage Hospital, you see," and the
bed was wanted.  There had been a landslip where
some local men were working&mdash;five cases&mdash;the main
ward simply crowded out.  Mr. Wriford must go to the
town infirmary over at Pendra&mdash;unless&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sure you haven't any friends?" said Doctor, looking
at Mr. Wriford closely.  "Quite sure?  Committee
here?  All right, Sister, I'm coming.  Quite sure?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford said: "Quite.  I had one.  He was with
me.  He was drowned.  Did they find&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, the coastguards who found you found a body
on the shore the same day.  Was that your friend?  A
big man&mdash;stout?"
</p>

<p>
"That was my friend," said Mr. Wriford; and asked:
"Is he buried here?"
</p>

<p>
"In the churchyard.  We knew nothing who he was,
of course.  There's just a wooden cross.  You'd like to
see it when you're better.  They've kept his things, or
at least a list of them.  You could identify by them.
Had he any friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Only me.  I think only me.  We met on the road."
</p>

<p>
"Poor chap," said Doctor.  "Washed off, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he jumped off.  He couldn't swim."
</p>

<p>
Doctor, who was going obedient to Sister's call,
turned and exclaimed: "Jumped off?  Why?"
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Wriford was lying back as he had lain these
many days, thinking.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Visiting Committee.  Visiting Committee tramped
and shuffled into the room and grouped about his bed
and stared at him&mdash;one clergyman addressed as
Vicar, one very red gentleman addressed as Major, two
other men and two ladies; all rather fat and not very
smartly groomed as though one rather ran to seed at
Port Rannock and didn't bother much about brushing
one's coat-collar or pressing one's trousers or&mdash;for the
ladies&mdash;keeping abreast of the fashions.  All meaning
to be kind, but all, after a while, rather inclined to be
huffy with this patient whose story Doctor had reported,
whom Doctor considered fit to be moved, but who
displayed no gratitude for all that had been done for
him, nor any sort of emotion when told that he
would be sent to Pendra Infirmary at the end of the
week.
</p>

<p>
Visiting Committee opened with a cheery joke on the
part of Major at which everybody smiled towards
the patient, but to which the patient made no sort of
response.  Visiting Committee in the persons of Major
and Vicar fired a few questions based upon Doctor's
information, at first kindly and then rather abrupt.
Patient just lay with wide eyes that never turned
towards the speaker and either answered: "Yes, thank
you," or "No, thank you," or did not answer at all.
Visiting Committee thought patient ungracious and
said so to itself as it moved away.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have spoken to them," said Nurse
a little reproachfully, coming to him afterwards.  "You
ought just to have said a little, Wriford&mdash;that's your
name, isn't it?  I think they'd have let you stay over
Christmas if you had.  Wouldn't you have liked to stay
with us for Christmas?"
</p>

<p>
"I just want to be alone," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"I told him," said Nurse, reporting this conversation
to Sister later in the day, "I told him that of course he'd
had a terrible time, but that he ought really to try not
to think so much about himself.  You know, when I
said that he turned his head right round to me, a
thing he never does, and stared at me in the oddest
way."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
If that was so it remained the only thing that aroused
him all the time he was at the Cottage Hospital.  Even
when the ambulance came over from Pendra Infirmary,
and Nurse and Sister tucked him up in it and
commended him to the care of the Infirmary nurse who
came in the carriage, even then, beyond thanking them
quietly, he neither turned his head for a last look nor
seemed in any degree distracted from his steady thoughts.
He just lay as before, gazing straight before him and
thinking, and continued so to lie and think when they
got him to bed in the large convalescent ward at the
Infirmary.
</p>

<p>
"Matey," said a husky voice from the bed beside
him, "Matey, I've got me portograph in the Daily
Mirror paper.  I'm the oldest sea-captain living, and
I've got all me faculties except only me left eye.  Can't
you move, Matey?  I've got me portograph in the
Daily Mirror paper.  I'll show you, Matey."
</p>

<p>
A sharp call down the ward.  "Father!  Get back
into bed this minute, Father!  I never did!  What are
you thinking about?  Get back this minute, Father!"
</p>

<p>
The oldest sea-captain living objected querulously:
</p>

<p>
"I've got me portograph in the Daily Mirror paper."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I'll take it away from you if you don't lie
still."
</p>

<p>
"Matey," said the oldest sea-captain living, "Matey,
I've got me portograph in the Daily Mirror paper."
</p>

<p>
He lay gazing before him, just thinking, thinking.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
These occupied Mr. Wriford's thoughts.  First of
that sacrifice made for him when, without hint of it,
without so much as good-bye, Mr. Puddlebox had swung
off his hands from the ledge and gone down into the
sea.  Why made for him?  How?
</p>

<p>
Doctor had asked it over at the Cottage Hospital:
</p>

<p>
"Jumped off?  Why?"
</p>

<p>
Ah, why?  Search it through the long days, ask it of
the night.  Follow, ah, follow it in dreaming; awake
to question it anew!  Sacrifice made for him!  What
must have been suffered in the determination to make
it?  What in its dreadful act?  And why, why?  Well, if
no answer to that, set it aside&mdash;set Why aside and seek
to find How?  How done?  Its courage wherein found,
where?
</p>

<p>
Why?  How?  How?  Why?  Ah, questions unanswerable;
ah, solutions never to be found!  Doctor's
questions over at the Cottage Hospital; wholly and
sanely Mr. Wriford's questions, there as he lay gazing
before him in the little room at Port Rannock, here as
he lay in the convalescent ward at Pendra Infirmary.
Why?  How?  How?  Why?  Wholly and sanely his
by day and day succeeding day, by night and night
succeeding night.  Wholly and sanely his&mdash;coldly
his.
</p>

<p>
Coldly: in time, and in the ceaseless effort to answer
them as strength returned and as he was encouraged to
get up and walk the ward, he found himself thinking,
nay, forced himself to think, of Mr. Puddlebox without
emotion: without emotion watching that very scene
upon the ledge, that drop into the water, that lumped-up
body bobbing round the cliff.  For him!  Was he worth
it?  No, not worthy it in any degree.  Had he done
anything to deserve it?  He had done nothing.  Narrowly,
coldly, he searched every moment of his days in
Mr. Puddlebox's company.  There was not one
revealed a single action, even a single thought, that
might give claim to such a sacrifice.  Far from it!
Consciously and actively and intentionally he had lived in
all that period for himself alone.  Till then he had
devoted all his life to others.  Through all the time
thereafter it had been his aim to live for himself&mdash;to
care for no one's feelings, himself to have no feelings:
simply to do things, simply to inflict upon his body
whatsoever recklessness his mind conceived: through
his body experience it, in his mind never to be touched
by it.  Whatever suffering it had caused him, gleefully
he had relished.  But Mr. Puddlebox also it had caused
suffering and discomfort, and Mr. Puddlebox had not
relished it at all: very much the reverse.  What claim
then had he on Mr. Puddlebox's affections?
</p>

<p>
Affections!  What had affections to do with such a
case?  Admit affections&mdash;God alone knew why, but
admit that the companionship of their many days
together, their many adventures, experiences, had
aroused common affection in Mr. Puddlebox.  Admit
that you scarcely could live with a man day by day,
night by night, hour by hour, without of two results
one: hating him and leaving him, or becoming
accustomed to him and accepting him.  That might arouse
affections, just as affections might be aroused by any
inanimate thing always carried: a stick, a penknife, a
comfortable old coat.  Admit affections then: what
had affection to do with accepting that dreadful
death&mdash;or any death?  That was more than affection.  That
was as much more than affection as a mountain a hill,
an ocean a stream.  That was love: nay, that was love's
very apotheosis.  Ridiculous, outrageous to imagine for
himself in Mr. Puddlebox any love: how much more
preposterous love in that degree!  Preposterous,
ridiculous&mdash;then why?  Leave it&mdash;ah, leave it, leave it, and come
to How.  Think of it coldly.  Divorce emotion from its
searching and coldly examine How.  How had
Mr. Puddlebox gone to such a death?  What found within
himself, what quality possessed, to swing him off his
hands and go, and drown, and die?  Courage?  Be
cold, be cruel, be sane!  Courage?  Puddlebox had no
courage.  Carelessness of life?  He was very fond of
life.  Look at the man!  Remember him, not as he died,
but in his grotesque personality as he lived.  Consider
his idle, slothful habit of mind and of body.  Recall his
dislike of work, of any hardship.  Look at his ideal of
comfort&mdash;to shuffle about the countryside doing
nothing; to have food to eat; to get comfortably drunk.
How in such character the courage to die so suddenly,
so horribly?  How?  Lo, How was more impossible
than Why.  Nay, How was Why.  What but supremest
love could have invested him with strength to go to such
a death?  What but divinest love to conceive of such a
sacrifice?  And love was out of consideration.  Useless
to try to delude these questions with: "He must have
loved me."  Clear that he could not have.  Then why?
Then done by possession of what attribute?  Was there
some quality in life unknown to Mr. Wriford?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Ah, was there?  That same question, a barrier
insurmountable, a void dark, boundless, unfathomable,
similar to that which ended his questioning of
Mr. Puddlebox's sacrifice, ended also his searching along
another train of thought which, as he grew stronger,
more and more closely occupied him&mdash;inquiry relative
to his own condition.  He had had a shot at life.  He
had cast aside every bond, every scruple, every fear,
every habit, which formerly&mdash;as he had thought&mdash;had
tied him up in misery.  That phase was over.  It
attracted no more.  He had longed to do it; he had
done it.  What profit?  He was very weak.  He found
that there had passed out of him with the vigour of his
body the violent desire to make his body do and feel and
suffer.  Vigour would return.  He would grow stronger.
Daily already he was regaining strength.  But that
desire never would return.  It had been exorcised.  It
had been fulfilled.  When he was in London, when he
was in all the tumult of that London life, he had
thought&mdash;God! if only he could break away from it all! break
away and rest his mind and bring the labour of living
from his head to his hands, from his brain to his body!
He had imagined his hands hard, his body sweating, his
mind free, and he had thought: "God, God, there, there,
could I but get at it, lies, not the labour of living, but the
joy of living!"  Well, he had got at it.  He had done
it.  Horny and hard he had made his hands; sore and
asweat he had wearied his body.  What profit?  He had
wanted to do things&mdash;things arduous, reckless, violent.
He had done them.  What benefit?  He had wanted to
care for nobody and nothing, to mind nobody's feelings,
to have none himself.  He had done it.  He had
wantonly insulted, he had wilfully outraged; he had
mastered fear, he had stifled moral consciousness.  What
virtue?  Look back upon it!  That which he had
desired to do he had done.  He had seized the course
where labour of living should be made joy of living.  He
had run it to the uttermost.  Mad dog&mdash;he had lived,
as he had wished to live, a mad dog life, impervious to
all sensation, moral or physical.  No qualm, no scruple,
no thought, no fear had checked him.  He had drunk
of it full and drunk of it deep.  What profit?  Soul, soul,
look back with me and see where we have come!  In the
old life never free.  In the new life utterly free.  In the
old responsible.  Utterly irresponsible in the new.  In
the old tied up&mdash;tied up, that had been his cry.  In the
new released.  What profit?  In the old assured that
happiness lay in the new.  Now the new tried, and
happiness still to seek&mdash;nay, happiness more lost, more
deeply hidden than ever before.  Then it had seemed to
lie in freedom; now freedom had been searched and
it was not.  Where then?  Was there some secret of
happiness that he had missed?
</p>

<p>
Suppose he were strong again.  Imagine the few weeks
passed that would return him his strength and let him
leave this place.  Would he go back to the wild things,
the reckless things, the schooling of his body by
exposure to pain, to hunger, to fatigue?  No, for it had
been tried.  No, for he had tasted it and was nothing
attracted to taste of it again.  Was he afraid of its
hurts?  No, impervious to them, minding them not at
all.  But he had exulted in them, he had been exalted
by them.  He had believed they were leading somewhere.
Ah, here he was looking back upon them, and he knew
that they led nowhere.  He had come through them,
and he found himself come through empty.  They might
fall about him again when he was strong and went out
to them&mdash;they might fall about him, but they would
arouse nothing in him.  He might once again challenge
them and cause them furiously to assail him.  He
would know while he did so and while they scourged
him that they were barren of virtue, empty, dry as
ashes, profitless, containing nothing, concealing nothing.
</p>

<p>
Where stood he?  Where?  Look, in the old days he
had been slave of his mind, hounded by his brain.  He
had cast that away.  He had escaped from it.  Look,
in the new he had turned for joy of living to his body
and had mastered his body and all his fears and all his
thoughts.  He had lived through two lives&mdash;life that
was not his own but given to others; life that was all
his own and to none but himself belonged.  Fruitless
both.  Was there some secret of happiness that he had
missed?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Ah, was there?  This, as the new year broke its bonds,
displaced all other thoughts, became Mr. Wriford's sole
obsession.  Was there something in life that he had
missed?  He was able now to take exercise daily in the
Infirmary grounds.  He would go on these occasions to
its furthest recesses.  His desire was to escape the
other inmates of the convalescent ward; to be alone;
to get away where in solitude he could pursue the
question that ceaselessly he revolved: Was there some
secret of happiness that he had missed?  He brought,
he could bring, no train of sequent reasoning to its
investigation.  He merely brooded upon it.  He merely
reviewed life as he had known it, saw how it had
crumbled at every step, and how it crumbled anew at
every re-examination of it, and wondered vaguely was
there some quality might have been brought into it to
cement it into a stable bridge that would have borne
him cheerily upraised upon it, something that might
yet be found&mdash;something that he had missed?  And
often, as his review carried him searching along the
period of Mr. Puddlebox, wondered vaguely whether
the final question of that sacrifice was related to this
final question of himself.  Had Mr. Puddlebox some
quality unknown to him?  Was there something in life
that he himself had missed?  Were the two questions
one question?  Was there one answer that should supply
both answers?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Daily, walking in the grounds or watching from the
windows, he watched the new year struggling from her
bonds.  He came to greet her in all her different moods
as a sentient creature&mdash;to envisage her as one in like
situation to his own.  She was struggling for
freedom&mdash;nay, not for freedom, but for her own possession.
The old year had her.  In winter's guise he held her.
Sometimes she escaped him, sometimes she was laughing
all about and everywhere, a young thing, a wild thing,
a timid thing.  For three days together she would so
reign, smiling, fluttering, free.  Then winter snatched
her back, overlaid her, jealously crushed her in his iron
bonds.  Sometimes she wept.  Sometimes here and there
she ran and laid her pretty trinkets on branch and
bough and hedge.  Winter would out and catch her,
drag her away, despoil all her little traces.  Sometimes
she fought him.  Sometimes as she smiled, as she
danced, as she bedecked herself, winter would come
shouting, blustering, threatening.  A bonny sight to
see her hold her own!  Bolder she grew, weaker he.  He
had his moments.  She sulked, she cried, she pouted,
then laughingly she tricked him.  Here he would catch
her.  Look, there she was away!  Here tear up her
handiwork: look, there her fingers ran!  His legions sank
exhausted: she laughed and called her own.  Warmly,
timidly, fragrantly her breezes moved about her;
greenly, freshly, radiantly she smiled to their caress.
They piped, she danced.  She was out, she was free.
She was high upon the hillside, she was deep within
the valley, she was painting in the hedgerows, she was
piping in the trees.
</p>

<p>
Where aimed she?  Ah, this was but the budding!
Soon, soon, supreme, content, mistress of all and of
herself she'd reign through starry nights, through
steadfast, silent days.  Peace she pursued, serenity,
content.  Peace she would win.  Mr. Wriford turned from
her when thus far his thoughts had followed her.  Daily
before him, petulant she struggled.  He had struggled.
Soon she'd be free.  He had been free.  Then pressed
she on to happiness.  He?
</p>

<p>
Was there some secret of happiness he had missed?

CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
CRACKJAW NAME FOR MR. WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Stronger now.  He was left very much alone by the
other inmates of the convalescent ward, and that was
what he wished.  Strange folk themselves, some with
odd ways, some with ugly, they accepted strangeness
in others as a proper qualification for those greater
comforts which made this department of the workhouse a
place highly desirable.  The one common sympathy
among them was to present their several ailments as
obstinately and as alarmingly as possible, and they
respected the endeavour in one another.  Except when
order of dismissal and return to the workhouse came
among them.  The victim upon whom the blow fell
would then most shamelessly round upon his mates in
a manner that filled the ward with indignant alarm and
protestation.
</p>

<p>
"Me quite strong!" the unhappy victim would cry.
"What about old George there?  He's stronger than
me.  What about old Tom?  What about Mr. Harris?
What about Captain Peter?  Shamming!  They're all
shamming!  Ask old George what he told me yesterday.
Never felt better in his life, he told me.  Ask old Tom.
Can't get enough to eat 'e's that 'arty, he says.  Me!
It's a public scandal.  It's a public scandal this ward
is.  Taking out a dying man, that's what you're doing,
and leaving a pack of shammers!  Look at Mr. Graggs
there!  Look at him.  Ever see a sick man look like
that?  Public scandal!  Public&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Outraged victim led protesting away.  Horrified
convalescents dividing their energies between smiling
wanly, as though at the point of death and therefore
charitable to victim's ravings, and protesting volubly
at his infamous aspersions.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, only wishing to be left alone, escaped
these bitter attacks from injured victims just as for a
long time he escaped from matron and doctors the form
of attention which aroused alarm in the ward.  He
mixed with his fellow-convalescents not at all, and this
aloofness, in a community where garrulity on the
subject of aches and pains and bad weather and discontent
with food was the established order, earned him in
full the solitude which alone he desired.  Its interruption
was most endangered in those hours of wet days, and
in the evenings, when, out of bed and dressed, the
convalescents were cooped up within the ward.  At the
least there was always then the risk of being caught by
the oldest sea-captain living with his ceaseless: "Matey!
Matey, I've got me portograph in the Daily Mirror
paper!" and sometimes the descent upon him of some
other infirm old gentleman who, worsted and enraged
in some battle of ailments with cronies, would espy
Mr. Wriford seated remote and alone and bear down
upon him with his cargo of ills.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
To escape these attentions Mr. Wriford learnt to
simulate absorption in one of the out-of-date illustrated
weekly papers with which for its intellectual benefit the
ward was supplied.  No thought that these papers were
once a part of his daily life, himself a very active factor
in theirs, ever stirred him as he turned the pages or
gazed with unseeing eyes upon them.  His fingers turned
the pages: his mind, in search of Was there some secret
of happiness he had missed? revolved the leaves of
retrospection that might disclose it&mdash;but never did.
His head would bend intensely above a picture or a
column of letterpress: his eyes, not what was printed
saw, but saw himself as he had been, somehow missing&mdash;what?
</p>

<p>
Seclusion by this means for his searching after his
problem brought him one day to an occurrence that did
actually concentrate his attention on the printed page
before his eyes&mdash;a page of illustrated matter that
concerned himself.  A new batch of weekly periodicals had
been placed in the ward&mdash;dated some two months
back.  He took one from the batch, opened it at random,
and seated himself, with eyes fixed listlessly upon it,
as far as might be from the gossiping groups gathered
about the fires at each end of the ward.  Absorbed more
deeply than usual in his thoughts, he carelessly allowed
it to be apparent that the journal was not holding his
attention.  It lay upon his knee.  His eyes wandered
from its direction.
</p>

<p>
"Matey," said the oldest sea-captain living,
suddenly springing upon him, "Matey, I got me portograph
in the Daily Mirror paper.  You ain't never 'ad a
fair look at it, Matey."
</p>

<p>
"Not now," said Mr. Wriford.  "I'm reading."
</p>

<p>
He took up the paper that had rested on his knees;
but the oldest sea-captain living placed upon it his
cherished cutting from the Daily Mirror paper.  "Well,
read that, Matey," said the oldest sea-captain living.
"That's better than any bit you've got there.  Look,
Matey.  Look what it says."  He indicated with a
trembling finger the smudged and thumbed lettering
beneath the smudged picture and read aloud: "'One
of the most remarkable men to be found in our
workusses&mdash;those re&mdash;those rep&mdash;those reposetteries of
strange 'uman flotsam&mdash;-is Cap'n Henery Peters, the
oldest sea-captain living.'  That's me, Matey.  See
my face?  'Cap'n Henery&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Wriford.  "Yes.  That's fine,"
and took up the cutting and handed it back.
</p>

<p>
"You ain't finished reading of it," protested the
oldest sea-captain living.
</p>

<p>
"I have.  I read quicker than you.  I'll read it again
in a minute.  I just want to finish this.  I'm in the
middle of it."
</p>

<p>
The oldest sea-captain living protested anew.  "You
wasn't reading when I come up to you.  I saw you
wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking.  I'd just stopped to think."
</p>

<p>
It was an unfortunate excuse, arousing a fellow
sympathy in the oldest sea-captain living.  "Why,
they do make you think, some of the words they writes,
don't they?" said he.  "Look at my
bit&mdash;re&mdash;rep&mdash;reposetteries&mdash;there's one for yer.  What's a
re&mdash;rep&mdash;reposettery?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't neither, Matey," said the oldest
sea-captain living, "an' I don't suppose that young chap
as wrote it did."  He pointed to the page upon which
Mr. Wriford seemed to be engaged.  "It's a cracker,
Matey.  You got some crackers there too by the look
of it."  He put his finger on a word of title lettering
that ran in bold type across the top.  "W-r-i-f-o-r-d,"
he spelt.  "That's a crackjaw name for yer.  What's
it spell, Matey?"
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Wriford, attracted by the crackjaw name
thus indicated, was now giving a real attention to the
paper.  The oldest sea-captain living concentrated upon
his own beloved features in the Daily Mirror paper,
and, engrossed upon them, drifted away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford read the headline, boldly printed:
</p>

<p class="t3b">
"THE WRIFORD BOOM: ANOTHER BRILLIANT NOVEL."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a review&mdash;a remarkable eulogy&mdash;of the
novel he had finished and deposited with his agent
shortly before that sudden impulse on the Thames
embankment.  It was embellished with photographs
of himself, with reproductions of the covers of his two
earlier novels, with inscriptions announcing the
prodigious number of editions into which they seemed
to have gone, and with extracts of "exquisite" or
"thought-provoking" or "witty" passages set in
frames.  Beneath that flaming "The Wriford Boom:
Another Brilliant Novel" was a long sub-title in small
black type epitomizing all that lay beneath it.
Mr. Wriford read it curiously.  In part it dealt with what
was described in inverted commas as his
"disappearance."  Evidently much on that head was general
knowledge.  The writer scamped details leading up to
his main point, the Wriford Boom and the contribution
thereto of a brilliant new novel, with many a plausible
"Of course."  The mystery of the disappearance which
was "of course" no longer a mystery; Mr. Wriford
had "of course" been seen by a friend leaving Charing
Cross by the Continental train a few days after his
disappearance; later he had "of course" been seen in
Paris, and he was now "of course" living somewhere
on the Continent in complete seclusion.  The writer
contrasted this modest escape from lionisation with the
conduct of other authors who "of course" need not be
named, and proceeded to tremendous figures of
book-sales, and of advance orders for the present volume,
making his point finally with "A boom which, if started
by the sensational 'disappearance,' has served to make
almost every section of the general public share in the
rare literary quality enjoyed by&mdash;comparatively
speaking&mdash;the few who recognized Mr. Wriford's genius at
the outset."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford read it all curiously, with a sense of
complete detachment.  He looked at the photographs of
himself, recalling the circumstances in which each had
been taken and feeling himself somehow as unrecognisably
different from them as the convalescent ward
was different from the surroundings shown by the
camera.  He read the review of the new book, especially
the passages quoted from it, recalling the thoughts with
which each had been written and feeling them somehow
to have belonged, not to himself, but to some other
person who had communicated them to him and now
had committed them to print.  He reckoned idly and
roughly the royalties that were represented by the
prodigious figures of sales, and realised that a very great
deal of money must be awaiting him in his agent's hands.
But the thought of the money&mdash;the positive wealth to
which it amounted&mdash;stirred him no more than the
glowing terms of his appreciation in critical and popular
opinion.  It aroused only this thought: the memory
that, in the days represented by those photographs,
money then also had given him no smallest satisfaction.
He had had no use for it.  He had had no time to use
it.  So with success&mdash;no interest in it, no time to enjoy
it; always driven, always driving to do something else,
to catch up.  Curious to think that once he would have
sparkled over it, rejoiced in the money, thrilled in the
triumph.  Young Wriford would have&mdash;Young Wriford,
that personality now immeasurably remote, whom once
he had been.  Why would Young Wriford have
delighted?  Ah, Young Wriford was happy.  Why?  What
knew he, what possessed he, in those far distant years,
that somehow had been lost, that he had thought, by
breaking away and not caring for anything or anybody,
to recover, that, now the experiment was over, showed
itself more deeply lost than ever before?  Where and
how had that attribute of happiness&mdash;whatever it
was&mdash;been dropped? ...
</p>

<p>
Lo, he was back again where the oldest sea-captain
living had found him and had interrupted him, the
paper fallen on his knees, his eyes gazing blankly before
him: was there some secret of happiness he had missed?
</p>

<p>
As he mused he was again disturbed&mdash;this time by
the Matron.  It was a Board day, she told him, and
he was to go before the guardians at once.  The guardians
were sitting late and had reached his case; ordinarily
it would not have come up till next fortnight; after
receiving the Medical Officer's report they attended
personally to all convalescent ward cases.
</p>

<p>
The Matron gave Mr. Wriford this information as
she conducted him to the Board-room door.  "It'll be
good-bye," she said, smiling at him kindly as she left
him&mdash;he was different from the generality of her
patients.  "It'll be good-bye.  You're passed out of the
C. W."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0404"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
CLURK FOR MR. MASTER
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Guardians sat at a long, green-covered table.  Large
plates of sandwiches and large cups of coffee were
supporting them against the strain of their labours in sitting
late, and they regarded Mr. Wriford with eyes that
stared from above busily engaged mouths.  A different
class of men from the members of the Cottage Hospital
Committee and, like the Matron, accustomed to a class
of pauper different from Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
His difference was advertised in his youth&mdash;a
quality very much abhorred by the honest guardians
as speaking to shocking idleness&mdash;and in the refinement
of his voice and speech&mdash;a peculiarity that lent itself
to banter and was used for such.
</p>

<p>
One addressed as Mr. Chairman first spoke him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've had a good fat thing out of us," said
Mr. Chairman, himself presenting the appearance of
having made a moderately fat thing out of his duties,
and speaking with one half of a large sandwich in his
hand and the other half in his mouth.  "Best part of
three months' board and lodging in slap-up style.
Number One.  Diet and luxuries ad lib.  What are you going
to do about it?  Are you going to pay for it?"
</p>

<p>
This was obviously a very humourous remark to make
to a pauper, and it received at once the gratifying
tribute of large sandwichy grins and chuckles all round
the table.
</p>

<p>
"I call upon Mr. Chairman," said one grin, "to tell
this gentleman exactly what he has cost the parish in
pounds, shillings and pence sterling."
</p>

<p>
This, by its reception, was equally humourous, one
Guardian being so overcome by the wit of "gentleman"
and "sterling" as to choke over his coffee and rise and
expectorate in the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen, fourteen, six," said Mr. Chairman, "and
as a point of order I call Mr. Master's attention to the
fact that another time a spittoon had better be provided
for the gentleman as has just needed the use of one."
</p>

<p>
The Workhouse Master who stood beside Mr. Chairman
having contributed obsequiously to the merriment
and banter aroused by this sparkle of humour,
Mr. Chairman loudly called the meeting to order and again
taxed Mr. Wriford with his debt to the parish.
</p>

<p>
"Sixteen, fourteen, six," said Mr. Chairman.  "Can
you pay it?  I lay you've never earned so much money
in all your life, so now then?"
</p>

<p>
In the days of wild escapade with Mr. Puddlebox,
Mr. Wriford's thoughts&mdash;all in some form of passion&mdash;worked
very rapidly.  Now, as though they had learnt
their gait from his slow revolving of his ceaseless
question, they worked very slowly; and when he spoke he
spoke very slowly.  His mind went slowly to the
account he had been reading of himself in the illustrated
paper.  He thought of the large sum that awaited him
in his agent's hands, and he thought, with an impulse
of the furious Puddlebox days, of the glorious sensation
he would arouse by bellowing at these uncouth creatures:
"Earned so much!  Well, I daresay I could buy up the
lot of you, you ugly-looking lot of pigs, and have as
much over again!"  But he allowed the impulse to drift
away.  He had done that sort of thing: to what profit?
He might do it.  He might follow it up by stampeding
about the room, hurling sandwiches at Guardians and
shouting with laughter at the amazement and
confusion while he did as much damage as he could before
he was overpowered.  What profit?  The excitement
would pass and be over.  It would lead to nothing that
would satisfy him.  It would bring him nowhere that
would rest him.  He had done that sort of thing.  It
attracted him no more.  Should he answer them
seriously&mdash;explain who he was, request that a telegram
should be sent to his agent, go back to his old life, take
up the success that awaited him?  What profit?  That,
too, he had tried.  That, too, would lead him nowhere,
bring him no nearer to his only desire.  He imagined
himself back in London, back in his own place once
more, enjoying the comforts he had earned, travelling,
amusing himself, settling to work again.  What profit?
Enjoyment!  Amusement!  He would find none.  They
and all that they meant lay hidden beneath some secret
of life that must be found ere ever he could touch
them&mdash;something for which always and always he would
be searching, something he had missed.  He had tried
it.  It had no attraction for him: rather it had a
thousand explanations, worries, demands, at whose very
thought he shuddered.  Let him drift.  Let him go
wheresoever any chance tide might take him.  Let him
be alone to think, to think, and haply to discover.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" said Mr. Chairman.
</p>

<p>
"If you think I'm fit to go, I'll go at once," said
Mr. Wriford.  "I'm very grateful for all that has been done
for me."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman reckoned that he ought to be.
"Where'll you go?" demanded Mr. Chairman.
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"What'll you do?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman thumped the table in expression of
one of the many trials that Guardians had to bear.
"What's the sense o' that talk?" demanded Mr. Chairman.
"Anywhere!  Don't know!  That's the way with
all you chaps.  Get outside and pretend you're starving
and pitch a fine tale about being turned out and get
rate-payers jawing or magistrates preachin' us a
lecture.  We've been there before, my beauty."
</p>

<p>
Chorus of endorsement from fellow-Guardians who
growl angrily at Mr. Wriford as though they had indeed
been there before and saw in Mr. Wriford the visible
embodiment of their misfortune.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what?" said Mr. Wriford helplessly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman with another thump, and as though
he had never asked a question throughout the
proceedings, announced that that was for him to say.
Mr. Master would find a bed for him and let him take jolly
good care that he earned it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be very glad to work," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman looked at him contemptuously.
"Plucky lot you can do, I expect!" said Mr. Chairman.
</p>

<p>
"I can do clerical work," said Mr. Wriford.  "Anything
in the way of writing or figures.  I'm accustomed
to that.  If there's anything like that until I'm fit to
go&mdash;"  A sudden faintness overcame him.  The room
was very hot, and the standing and the questioning,
while all the time he was thinking of something else,
possessed him, in his weak state, with a sudden giddiness.
He smiled weakly and said "I'm sorry" and sat
down abruptly on a chair that fortunately was close to
him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Master bent over Mr. Chairman and whispered
obsequiously on a subject in which the words "our
clurk" were frequently to be heard.  "Gentlemen,"
said Mr. Chairman, "Mr. Master suggests that we
might leave over the business of appointing a boy-clurk
till our next meeting, while he sees if this man
can give him any help.  I want to get home to my
supper, and I expect you do.  Agreed, gentlemen?"
</p>

<p>
"Agreed," chorused the gentlemen, throwing down
pens and taking up new sandwiches with the air of men
who had performed enormous labours and were virtuously
happy to be rid of them.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chairman nodded at Mr. Master.  "Keep his
nose to it," said Mr. Chairman.
</p>

<p>
"This way," said Mr. Master to Mr. Wriford; and
Mr. Wriford got slowly to his feet and followed him
slowly through a door he held ajar.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Stronger now.  Increasingly stronger as day succeeded
day and the year came more strongly into her own.
Only waiting a little more strength, so he believed, to
betake himself from Pendra Workhouse and go&mdash;anywhere.
Actually, as the event that did at last
prompt him to go might have told him, it was a reason,
a shaking-up, a stirring of his normal round, rather than
sufficient strength that he awaited.  In a numbed and
listless and detached way he was not uncomfortable in
the new circumstances to which he was introduced after
the Board-room interview.  The Master, removed from
the obsequious habit that he wore when before the
Guardians, showed himself not unkindly.  He conceived
rather a liking for Mr. Wriford.  Mr. Wriford performed
for him the duties of boy-"clurk" in a manner that was
of the greatest assistance to him.  He reported very
favourably on the matter to the Guardians; and when
Mr. Wriford spoke of taking his discharge put forward
a proposition to which the Guardians found it
convenient to consent.  Why lose this inmate of such
valuable clurkly accomplishments?  Why not offer him
his railway fare home, wherever in reason that might
be, if he stayed, say a month, and continued to assist
the Master?  At the end of that time he might be offered
a very few shillings a week to continue further&mdash;if
wanted.  Mr. Master carried the proposition to
Mr. Wriford.  Mr. Wriford in a numbed, listless and
detached way said: "All right, yes."  He was taken
from the workhouse ward where till then he had slept
and accommodated in a tiny box-room in the Master's
quarters.  His nose was kept at it, as Mr. Master had
been desired.  His duties were capable of extension in
many directions.  That he fulfilled them in a numbed,
listless, and detached fashion was none to the worse in
that he accepted them without complaint whatever
they might be.  "I call him: 'All right, yes,'"
Mr. Master obsequiously told the Guardians.  "That's
about all ever he says.  But he does it a heap.  Look
at the way the stores are entered up.  I've had him
checking them all this week."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0405"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
MAINTOP HAIL FOR THE CAPTAIN
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The event that at last aroused Mr. Wriford and took
him far from Pendra was supplied by the oldest
sea-captain living on that distinguished personage's
birthday.  The oldest sea-captain living "went a bit in his
legs" shortly after Mr. Wriford had entered upon the
new phase of his duties.  He was provided with a
wheeled-chair, and Mr. Wriford found him seated in
this in the grounds one day, abandoned by his cronies
and weeping softly over his beloved portograph in the
Daily Mirror paper.  He wept, he told Mr. Wriford,
because none of them blokes ever took any notice of
him now.  The finer weather kept the blokes largely
out of doors, and they would go off and leave him.
"I'm the oldest sea-captain living, Matey," said he
in a culminating wail, "and I've got me portograph in
the Daily Mirror paper.  It's cruel on me.  'Ave a look
at it, Matey."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford pushed the wheeled-chair and the oldest
sea-captain living about the grounds all that afternoon,
and the task became thereafter a part of his daily
occupation.  It was not a duty.  It merely became a habit.
The face of the oldest sea-captain living would light up
enormously when he saw Mr. Wriford approaching, and
he would thank him affectionately when each voyage
in the wheeled-chair was done, but Mr. Wriford was
never actively conscious of finding pleasure in the old
man's gratitude.  He never conversed with him during
their outings&mdash;and had no need to converse.  The
oldest sea-captain living did all the talking, chattering
garrulously and with the wandering of a fading old mind
of his ships, his voyages, and his adventures, and
ecstatically happy so to chatter without response.  He
was born in Ipswich, he told Mr. Wriford, and he was
married in Ipswich and had had a rare little house in
Ipswich and had buried his wife in Ipswich.  Whenever,
in his chattering, he was not at sea he was at Ipswich,
and the reiteration of the word gradually wormed a
place into Mr. Wriford's mind, creeping in by persistent
thrusts and digs through the web and mist of his own
thoughts which, as he revolved them, enveloped him
numbed, listless, detached from the oldest sea-captain
living and his chattering as from all else that surrounded
him in the workhouse.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Yet an event proved that not only the name Ipswich
but some feeling for this its famous son, some sense of
happiness in the hours devoted to the wheeled-chair,
also had found place in his mind.  A birthday of the
oldest sea-captain living brought the event.  In
celebration of the occasion the oldest sea-captain living
was permitted to give a little tea-party in the
convalescent ward.  Some dainties were provided and with
them just the tiniest little drop of something in the
oldest sea-captain's tea.  Enormously exhilarated, the
oldest sea-captain living obtained of the Matron
permission to send a special request to Mr. Wriford to
attend the festivities, and enormously exhilarated he
showed himself when Mr. Wriford came.  Flushed and
excited he sat at the head of the table in full possession
once more of the ear of his companions and making up
for previous isolation by chattering tremendously of
his exploits.  Roused to immense heights by his sudden
popularity and by virtue of the little drop of something
in his tea, he gave at intervals, to the great delight of
the assembly, an example of how he used to hail the
maintop in foul weather when master of his own ship.
With almost equal force of lungs he hailed Mr. Wriford
when Mr. Wriford appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Hallo, Matey!" hailed the oldest sea-captain living.
"Ahoy, Matey!  Ahoy!"
</p>

<p>
No doubt about the affection and gratitude that
Matey had aroused in him by perambulation of the
wheeled-chair.  Even Mr. Wriford himself was touched
and aroused and caused to smile by the flushed and
beaming countenance that called him to a seat beside
him and by the pressure of the trembling hands that
grasped his own and drew him to a chair.  "Matey!"
cried the oldest sea-captain living, "I'm ninety-nine,
and I can hail the maintop fit to make the roof come
down.  Listen to me, Matey."
</p>

<p>
Gurgles of anticipation all round the table.  "Now
this is to be the last time, Father," said the Matron,
coming to them.  "There's too much noise here, and
you'll do yourself an injury if you're not careful.  The
last time, now!"
</p>

<p>
It was the last time.
</p>

<p>
The oldest sea-captain living took an excited sip at
his cup of tea with the little drop of something in it,
then caught at Mr. Wriford's shoulder, and drew himself
to his full height in his chair.  His other hand he
put trumpet shape to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Maintop! ahoy, there!" trumpeted the oldest
sea-captain living.  He inspired a long, wheezing
breath.  Mr. Wriford could feel the hand clutching
on his shoulder.  "Ahoy!  Maintop, ahoo!  Ahoy!
A&mdash;!"
</p>

<p>
The fingers on Mr. Wriford's shoulder bit into his
flesh as though there was returned to them all the vigour
that had been theirs when first that voice bawled along
a deck.  So sharp, so fierce the pinch that he looked up
startled.  Startled also the other faces along the table,
and startled the Matron, frightened and running
forward.  They saw what he saw&mdash;saw the blood well out
horribly upon the oldest sea-captain's mouth, felt the
grip relax, and saw him crash horribly upon the tea-cups.
</p>

<p>
Lift him away.  Call the doctor.  Call the doctor.
Lift him, lay him here.  Send away those gibbering,
frightened old men huddling about him.  Lay him here.
Wipe those poor old lips.  "There, Father, there!"  What
does he want?  What is it he wants?  What is he
trying to say?  Listen, bend close.  "Matey,
Matey!"  Mr. Wriford jumps up from kneeling beside him and
runs to the table; snatches up a grimy newspaper-cutting
lying there and brings it to the oldest sea-captain
living; puts it in his fingers and sees the fingers
close upon it and sees the glazing eyes light up with
great happiness.  "Matey!"  Very faintly, scarcely to
be heard.  "Matey!"  He is thanking him.  "Matey!
Gor bless yer, Matey!"  There is a bursting feeling in
Mr. Wriford's heart.  Words come choking out of it.
"Captain!  Captain!  You've got your photograph.
Take you out for a ride to-morrow, Captain!  Better
now?  Captain!"  Captain's lips are moving.  He is
thanking him.  Ay, with his soundless lips
thanking, with his spirit answering his call from the
main-top....
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Father!" says Matron, rising from her
knees.
</p>

<p>
Captain has answered.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Attendants carry the body to an adjoining room.
Mr. Wriford follows it and stays by it.  He is permitted to
stay and stays while darkness gathers.  What now? for
now a change again.  To push the wheeled-chair had
been a habit, not a pleasure.  Was that sure?  Why is
it pain to think to-morrow will not bring that lighting
of those eyes, that chatter of those lips?  Why in his
heart that bursting swell a while ago?  Why swells it
now as darkness shrouds that poor old form?  Had he
without knowing it been happy in that task? without
knowing it, come near then to something in life that he
had missed?  What now?  Well, now he would go away.
What here?  Ah, in the dusk that masses all about the
room, bend close and peer and ask again.  What
here?  Look, those stiff fingers clutch that portograph.
Look, those stained lips are smiling, smiling.  He is
happy.  He was always happy when Matey came.
Has he taken happiness with him?  Was it within
grasp and not recognised and now missed again&mdash;gone?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford takes his discharge.  Guardians, holding
to their word, take him his railway ticket.  The Master
is genuinely sorry.  When at last, on the night of the
oldest sea-captain's death, he finds Mr. Wriford
determined, "Well, the Guardians will be sitting to-morrow,"
he says.  "I'll tell 'em.  They'll take your ticket
for you.  Where to?"
</p>

<p>
He has to repeat the question.  Fresh from the death-bed
and its new turn to the old thoughts, Mr. Wriford
is even more than commonly absent and bemused.
"Where to?" repeats Mr. Master.  "Where's your
friends you want to go to?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford takes the first place that comes into his
head.  Very naturally it is the name that has edged a
place in his mind by repeated reiteration during
perambulation of the wheeled-chair.
</p>

<p>
"Ipswich," says Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
Guardians think it a devil of a big fare to pay and
grumble a bit.  On the one hand, however, this inmate
has saved a boy-"clurk's" wages now for some
considerable period: on the other, Ipswich will take him
hundreds of miles beyond danger of starving and falling
back on their hands and making a general nuisance of
himself.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Ipswich," says Mr. Chairman.
"Agreed, gentlemen?"  Agreed.  "Take the ticket
yourself, Mr. Master," says Mr. Chairman, "and
see him into the train.  None of his larks, you
know!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
So it is done.  On the day previous to his departure
Mr. Wriford has a holiday from Mr. Master and walks
over to Port Rannock, to the churchyard.  He has
identified while in the Infirmary the list of clothes
and pathetic oddments&mdash;bundle of thirty-five coppers
among them, paid in towards expenses of burial&mdash;found
on the body of Mr. Puddlebox and has been told the
grave lies just in the corner as you enter.  It is just a
grass-grown mound, nameless, that he finds.  An old
man who seems to be the sexton confirms his question.
Yes, that was a stranger found drowned back in
November.  The last burial here.  Long-lived place, Port
Rannock.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford stands a long while beside it&mdash;thinking.
How go you now, Puddlebox?  If you stood here&mdash;"O
all ye graves, bless ye the Lord, praise Him&mdash;"  That
would be your way.  How go you now?  Puddlebox&mdash;that
wasn't your real name, was it?&mdash;Puddlebox, why
did you do it?  Puddlebox, how did you do it?  Puddlebox,
I'm going off again.  I don't know what's going to
happen.  I'm just going.  I wish to God&mdash;I'd give
anything, anything, to have you with me again.  You
can't.  Well, how go you now?  Can you think of me?
Have you found what I can't find&mdash;what I've missed?
Ah, it was always yours.  You were always happy.
How?  Why?  Down you went, down and drowned for
me, for me!  Down without even good-bye.  Why?
How? ...
</p>

<p>
The sexton, locking up his churchyard, turned
Mr. Wriford out.  "Well, good-bye," said Mr. Wriford to
the nameless mound and carried his thoughts and his
questions back along the road to the Workhouse.  Ah,
carried them further and very long.  With him, now
centring about Mr. Puddlebox and now about the
perplexity of the something touched and something lost
again in the oldest sea-captain living, during the long
journey to London; with him again towards Ipswich.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
VI
</h4>

<p>
He crossed London by the Underground Railway.
He did not want to see London.  The second part of
his journey, in the Ipswich train, was made in a crowded
carriage, amid much staring and much chatter.  A long
wait was made at a station.  Why Ipswich?  And what
then?  Well, what did that matter?  But why stay
stifled up in here?  He got up and left the compartment
and passing out of the station among a crowd of
passengers gave up his ticket without being questioned on
it.  Evening was falling.  He neither asked nor cared
where he was.  Only those thoughts, those questions
that had come with him in the train, concerned him,
and pursuing them, he followed a road that took him
through the considerable town in which he found
himself and into the country beyond it.  The month was
May, the night, as presently it drew about him, warm
and gentle.  A hedgeside invited him, and he sat down
and after a little while lay back.  He did not trouble
to make himself comfortable.  There was nothing he
wanted.  There was only one thought into which all
the other thoughts shaped: was there some secret of
happiness he had missed?

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
IN A FIELD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Sandwiches, supplied in liberal manner by Mr. Master
and not touched on the railway journey, sufficed
Mr. Wriford's needs through the following day.  He
tramped aimlessly the greater part of the time.  Evening
again provided him with a bed by the roadside.  It was
the next morning, to which he awoke feeling cold and
feeling ill, that aroused him to his first thoughts of his
present situation.  He clearly must do something; but
he had only negative ideas as to what it should be.
Negative, as that, in passing a farm, it crossed his mind
to apply for work as had been the practice with
Mr. Puddlebox.  But he recalled the nature of that work
and was at once informed that he was now completely
unfitted for it.  He had been very strong then.  He felt
very weak now.  He had then been extraordinarily
vigorous and violent in spirit, and his spirit's violence
had led him to delight in exercising his body at manual
labour.  Now he felt very weary and submissive in
mind; and that feeling of submission was reflected in
extreme lassitude of his limbs.  It came back to this&mdash;and
at once he was returned again to his mental
searching&mdash;that then there seemed object and relief in taxing
himself arduously: now he had proved that trial and
knew that no object lay beyond it, that no relief would
ever now be contained in it.  And in any event he was
not capable of it: he was weak, weak; he felt very
ill.
</p>

<p>
But something must be done.  Let him determine
how he stood; and with this thought he began for the
thousandth time to rehearse his life as he had lived it.
One of the lucky ones: he had been that: it had driven
him into the river.  One of the free: that also he now
had been.  Those months with Puddlebox he had cared
for nothing and for nobody: recked nothing whether he
lived or died.  He had worked with his hands as in the
London days he had imagined happiness lay in working.
He had attained in brimming fulness all that in the
London days he had madly desired.  It had brought
him where now he was&mdash;to knowledge that there was
something in life he had missed, and to baffled, to
bewildered ignorance what it might be or in what manner
of living it might be found.  Well, let him drag on.  Just
to drag on was now the best that he could do.  Let life
take him and do with him just whatsoever it pleased.
Let him be lost, be lost, to all who knew him and to all
and everything he knew.  Let him a second time start
life afresh, and this time not attack it as in the wild
Puddlebox days he had attacked it, but be washed by
it any whither it pleased, stranded somewhere and
permitted to die perhaps, perhaps have disclosed to
him, and be allowed to seize, whatever it might be that
somehow, somehow, somewhere, somewhere, he had
missed.
</p>

<p>
Thus, as aimlessly he wandered, his thoughts took
the form of plans or resolutions, yet were not resolutions
in any binding sense.  They drifted formlessly through
his mind as snatches of conversation, carried on in a
crowded apartment, will drift through a mind pre-occupied
with some idea; or they drifted through him
as snow at its first fall will for long drift over and seem
to leave untouched any stone that rises above the
surface of the ground.  He was preoccupied with his own
ceaseless questioning.  He was preoccupied with helpless
and hopeless sense of helplessness and hopelessness.
There was something that others found that gave them
peace and gave them happiness, that he had missed,
that he knew not where he had missed or where to
begin to find.
</p>

<p>
All of plan or resolution that in any way settled upon
this deeper brooding was that somehow he must find
something to do.  In the midst of his brooding he would
jolt against realisation of that necessity, think
aimlessly upon it for a little, then lose it again.  Slowly it
permeated his mind.  Evening brought him to the
outskirts of a small town; and at a house in a by-street
where "Beds for Single Men" were offered, and where
he listlessly turned in, the matter of being called upon
for the price of a lodging shook him to greater
concentration upon his resources.  He found that, by
Mr. Master's carelessness or kindness, he had been left with
a trifle of change over the money given him to make his
way across town when he broke his journey in
London&mdash;elevenpence.  He paid ninepence for his bed.  In the
morning there remained to him two coppers for food,
and he knew himself faint with protracted fasting.
In a street of dingy shops he turned into a coffee-house.
"Shave?" said a man in soiled white overalls, and he
realised that he had mistaken the door and stepped into
a barber's adjoining the refreshment shop.  He was
unshaven, and any work that he could do would demand
a reasonably decent appearance.  "Attend to you in a
moment," said the soiled overalls, and Mr. Wriford
dropped into a chair to await his pleasure.  The ragged
fragment of a local newspaper lay on a table beside him,
and he took it up with some vague idea of discovering
employment among the advertisements.  That portion
of the paper was missing.  His eye was attracted by an
odd surname, "Pennyquick," and when the barber
called him and was operating on him he found himself
listlessly reflecting upon what he had read of an inquest
following the sudden death of the assistant-master at
Tower House School, chief evidence given by
Mr. Pennyquick, headmaster.
</p>

<p>
A penny was the price of his shave.  He took his
penny that remained into the adjoining coffee-shop and
obtained with it a large mug of cocoa.  "Three ha'pence
with a slice of bread and butter," said the woman at
the counter, pushing the cocoa towards him.  "Don't
you want nothing to eat?"
</p>

<p>
Her tone and the look she gave him were kindly.  "I
want it," said Mr. Wriford significantly.
</p>

<p>
"You look like it," said the woman.  "There!" and
slid him a hunk of dry bread.
</p>

<p>
He tried to thank her.  He felt strangely overcome
by her kindness.  Tears of weakness sprang to his eyes;
but no words to his mouth.  "That's all right," she
said.  "You're fair starved by the look of you."
</p>

<p>
He puzzled as he finished his meal, and as he wandered
out and up the street again, to know why he had
been so touched by the woman's action.  He found
himself feeling towards her that same swelling in his
heart as when the oldest sea-captain living with stained
lips had whispered: "Matey!  Matey!"
</p>

<p>
Was there something in life that he had missed?
What in the name of God had that to do with being given
a piece of bread?
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
He found himself late in the afternoon reaching the
end of a deserted road of widely detached villas.  The
last house carried on its gate a very dingy brass plate.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  TOWER HOUSE SCHOOL<br />
  JAMES PENNYQUICK, B.A.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Pennyquick?  Pennyquick?  It was the name that
had caught his attention in the paper at the barber's.
What had he read about it?  He trailed on a few steps
and remembered the inquest on the assistant-master,
and stopped, and stared.
</p>

<p>
A rough field lay beyond the house.  It was separated
from the road by barbed-wire fencing which trailed
between dejected-looking poles that at one time had
supported it but now bowed towards the ground in various
angles of collapse.  Within the field were pitched at
intervals decayed cricket stumps set in a wide circle,
and there stood about dejectedly in this circle
dejected-looking boys to the number of eighteen or twenty.  At
intervals, as Mr. Wriford stood and watched, the boys
stirred into a dejected activity which gave them the
appearance of being engaged in a game of rounders.  A
gentleman, wearing on his head a dejected-looking
mortar-board without a tassel, and beneath it untidy
black garments of semi-clerical appearance, imparted
these intervals of activity to the boys.  He paced the
field in a series of short turns near the house, hands
behind his back, head bent, and, as Mr. Wriford could
see, sucking in the cheeks of a coarse-looking face
surrounded by scrubby whiskers of red hair.  Every now
and then he would throw up his head towards the
dejected-looking boys and bawl "PLAY UP!" whereupon
the dejected-looking boys would give momentary
attention to their game.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford stepped over the trailing wire and
approached the maker of this invigorating call.  "Excuse
me," said Mr. Wriford, come within speaking distance.
"Are you Mr. Pennyquick?"
</p>

<p>
Halted in his pacing at sight of Mr. Wriford, the
gentleman thus addressed awaited him with lowered
head and lowering gaze much as a bull might regard the
first movements of an intruder.  He sucked more
rapidly at his cheeks as Mr. Wriford came near, and for
a space sucked and fiercely stared after receiving the
question.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what if I am?" he then returned.  His voice
was extraordinarily harsh, and he came forward a step
that brought his face close to Mr. Wriford's and stared
more threateningly than before.  His eyes were dull and
heavily bloodshot, and there went with the sucking at
his cheeks a nervous agitation that seemed to possess
his neck and all his joints.  "What if I am?" he
demanded again, and his words discharged a reek
communicative of the fact that, whoever he was, abstinence
from alcohol was not among his moral principles.
</p>

<p>
"By any chance," said Mr. Wriford, "do you happen
to want an assistant-master?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't want you."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might want temporary assistance."
</p>

<p>
He was stared at a moment from the clouded eyes.
Then, in another volume of the fierce breath, "Well,
you thought wrong!" he was told.  "Now!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Mr. Wriford and turned away.
</p>

<p>
He went a dozen paces towards the road.  There
seized him as he turned and as he walked away a sudden
realisation of his case, a sudden panic at his plight, a
sudden desperation to cling on to what he believed
offered here.  He must find something to do.  There
could be no concealment, no peace for him while he
wandered outcast and penniless.  That way lay what
most he feared.  He would be found wandering or found
collapsed, and questions would be asked him and
explanations demanded of him.  That terrified him.  He
could not face that.  Whatever else happened he must
be left alone.  He must find something to do that would
hide him&mdash;give him occupation enough to earn him
food and shelter and leave him to himself to think.
</p>

<p>
He turned and went back desperately.  The man he
believed to be Mr. Pennyquick was standing staring
after him and waited staring as he came on.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Mr. Wriford desperately.  "Look
here, Mr. Pennyquick.  I know you think it strange my
coming to you like this.  But I heard, I heard in the
town, that you wanted an assistant-master.  If you
don't&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I've told you," said Mr. Pennyquick, admitting
the personality by not denying it, "I've told you I
don't want you.  Now!"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't," said Mr. Wriford, unheeding the
rebuff, more desperate by reason of it, "if you don't,
there's an end of it.  But if you want temporary
help&mdash;temporary, a day, or a week&mdash;I can do it for
you."
</p>

<p>
"Do what?" demanded Mr. Penny quick.
</p>

<p>
"I can teach," said Mr. Wriford.  There was sign of
relenting in Mr. Pennyquick's question, and Mr. Wriford
took it up eagerly.  "I can teach," he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"What can you teach?"
</p>

<p>
"I can teach all the ordinary subjects."
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting a University man," said Mr. Pennyquick.
</p>

<p>
"Temporarily," Mr. Wriford urged.  As every
passage of their conversation brought him nearer this
sudden chance or threw him further from it, his panic
at its failure, and what must happen, then increased
desperately.  "Temporarily," he urged.  "I've had a
public-school education."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you look it!" said Mr. Pennyquick, and
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"English subjects," cried Mr. Wriford.  "Latin,
mathematics.  I can do it if you want it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pennyquick glanced over his shoulder at his
dejected-looking boys, then stared back again at
Mr. Wriford and began to speak with more consideration and
less fierceness.  "I'm not saying," said Mr. Pennyquick,
"that I don't want temmo&mdash;temmer&mdash;PLAY UP!
Tem-po-rary assistance.  I do.  I'm very ill.  I'm shaken
all to bits.  I ought to be in bed.  What I'm saying is
I don't want you.  I don't know anything about you.
I've got the reputation of my school to consider.  That's
what I'm saying to you."
</p>

<p>
Dizziness began to overtake Mr. Wriford&mdash;the field
to rock in long swells, Mr. Pennyquick by turns to
recede and advance, swell and diminish.  He felt
himself upon the verge of breaking down, wringing his hands
in his extremity and staggering away.  But where?
Where?  "Temporarily," he pleaded.  "Temporarily."
</p>

<p>
"You might drink for all I know," said Mr. Pennyquick,
pronouncing this possibility as if consumed with
an unnatural horror of it.
</p>

<p>
"I don't drink."
</p>

<p>
"How do I know that?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford cried frantically: "It's only temporarily!
If I drink, if I'm not suitable, you can stop it
in a moment."
</p>

<p>
"No notice?" said Mr. Pennyquick.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no notice.  Temporarily&mdash;it's only temporarily.
That'll be understood."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if no notice is understood I'll take the risk&mdash;for
a week, while I'm getting a man.  I'll give you fifteen
shillings.  No, I won't.  I'll give you twelve.  I'll give
you twelve shillings, and if I have to sack you before
the week's out&mdash;well, you just go.  That's understood?"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," Mr. Wriford said.  The field was
spinning now.  He could think of nothing else to say.
"Thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Be here at nine to-morrow," said Mr. Pennyquick.
"Just before nine," and he turned away and shouted to
his boys: "Stop now!  Come in now!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;" said Mr. Wriford.  "But&mdash;but&mdash;"  He
was trying for words to frame his difficulty.  "But&mdash;do
I live in?"
</p>

<p>
"Live in!" cried Mr. Pennyquick.  "I'm taking
risks enough having you at all!  Live in!  Stop now.
Come in now!" and he walked away towards the house.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
IN A PARLOUR
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Lights in all the windows and in the street lamps as
Mr. Wriford regained the town.  Night approaching&mdash;and
he terrified of its approach.  Little chill was in the
air, yet as he walked he trembled and his teeth
chattered.  He was shaken and acutely distressed by
revulsion of the effort to cling on and achieve his purpose
against Mr. Pennyquick's domineering savagery.  He
was worse shaken and worse distressed by mounting
continuance of the panic at his plight that had driven
him to the interview.  That plight and to what it might
lead had suddenly been revealed to him as he walked
away after the first rebuff.  Now it utterly consumed
him.  He shrunk from the gaze of passers-by.  He
avoided with more than the fear of an evil-doer the
police constables who here and there were to be seen.
His urgent desire was concealment, to be left alone, to
be quiet.  His fear was to be apprehended, found
destitute, questioned, interfered with.  Questioning: that
was his terror; solitude: that was his want.  He wanted
to hide.  He wanted to hide from every sort of
connection with what in two different phases he had lived
through, and in each come only to misery.  He told
himself that if, in obedience to his bodily desires&mdash;his
hunger, his extreme physical wretchedness&mdash;he were
somehow to get in communication with London and
enjoy the money and the place that waited him there&mdash;that
would be the very quick of intolerable meeting
with his old self again.  Unthinkable that!  If his
bodily desires&mdash;his faintness, his extreme
exhaustion&mdash;overcame him, there would be meeting the old life
in guise of explanations, of dependence again in
infirmary or workhouse.  No, he must somehow be alone; he
must somehow live where none should interfere with
him and where he might on the one hand be occupied
and on the other be able to sit aside from all who knew
him or might bother him, and thus pursue his quest: was
there some secret of happiness in life that he had missed?
These bodily miseries would somehow, somewhere, be
accommodated or would kill him: this mental
searching&mdash;ever?
</p>

<p>
There was upon him accumulation of wretchedness
such as in all his wretchedness of his accursed life he
never had endured.  At its worst in the old days, the
days of being one of the lucky ones, there had shone like
a lamp to one lost in darkness the belief that if he could
get out of it all he would end it all.  Ah, God, God, he
had escaped it and was in worse condition for his escape!
The belief had been tested&mdash;the belief was gone.  In
the wild Puddlebox days he had beaten off wretchedness
with violence of his hands and of his body, believing that
it ever could thus be beaten.  God, it had beaten him,
never again in that deluded spirit could be faced.  In
the infirmary he had begun his wondering after something
in life that he had missed.  Lo, here was he come
out to find it, and Christ! it was not, and Christ! he
might not now so much as sit and rest and ponder it.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself hunted.  He felt every eye turned
upon him within whose range he came; every hand
tingling suddenly to clutch him and stop him; every
voice about to cry: "Here, you!  You, I say!  What
are you doing?  Where do you live?  Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
He felt himself staggering from his dreadful faintness
and thereby conspicuous.  Thrice as he stumbled round
any corners that he met he found himself passing a
constable who each time more closely stared.  He took
another turning.  It showed him again that same
policeman at the end of the street.  He dared not turn
back.  That would be flight, his disordered mind told
him, and he be followed.  He dared not go on.  There
was a little shop against where he stood.  Its lighted
window displayed an array of gas-brackets, a variety
of glass chimneys and globes for lamps and gas, some
coils of lead piping, and in either corner a wash-basin
fitted with taps.  There was inscribed over this shop
</p>

<p class="t3">
  HY. BICKERS, CERT. PLUMBER<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and attached to a pendent gas bracket within the
window was a card with the announcement:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  LODGER TAKEN<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford made a great effort to steady himself;
steadied his shaking hand to press down the latch; and
to the very loud jangle of an overhead bell entered the
tiny shop that the door disclosed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
There was sound of conversation and the clatter of
plates from a brightly-lit inner parlour.  Mr. Wriford
heard a voice say: "I'll go, Essie, dear," and there
came out to him a nice-looking little old woman,
white-haired and silvery-hued, rather lined and worn, yet
radiating from her face a noticeable happiness, as though
there was some secret joy she had, who smiled at him
in pleasant inquiry.
</p>

<p>
"I'm looking for a lodging," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
At her entry she had left the parlour door open behind
her, and at Mr. Wriford's words there came to him
through it a bright girlish voice which said: "There,
now!  Jus' what I was saying!  Isn't that funny, though!
Let's have a laugh!" and with it, as though Mr. Wriford's
statement had conveyed the jolliest joke in the
world, the merriest possible ring of laughter.
</p>

<p>
The woman smiled at Mr. Wriford; and there was
in the laugh something so infectious as to make him,
despite his wretchedness, smile in response.  She went
back to the door and closed it.  "That's our Essie,"
she said, speaking as though Mr. Wriford in common
with everybody else must know who Essie was.  "She's
such a bright one, our Essie!"  The secret happiness
that seemed to lie behind her years and behind the lines
of her face shone strongly as she spoke.  One might
guess that "Our Essie" was it.  Then she answered
Mr. Wriford's statement.  "Well, we've got a very
nice bedroom," she told him.  "Would you like to see
it?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure it's nice," said Mr. Wriford.  His voice,
that he had tried to strengthen for this interview, for
some ridiculous reason trembled as he spoke.  The
reason lay somewhere in the woman's motherly face and
in her happy gleaming.  He felt himself stupidly
affected just as he had been affected&mdash;recurrence of the
sensation brought the scenes before his eyes&mdash;by the
last appeal to him of the oldest sea-captain living, and
by the kindly action of the woman in the coffee-shop
who had given him a piece of bread early that morning.
"I'm sure it's nice," he said again, repeating the words
to correct the stupid break in his voice.  "Would you
tell me the price?"
</p>

<p>
"Won't you sit down?" said the woman.  "You do
look that tired!"
</p>

<p>
He murmured some kind of thanks and dropped into
a chair that stood by the counter.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him very compassionately before she
answered his question.  "Tiring work looking for
lodgings," she said.
</p>

<p>
He nodded&mdash;very faint, very wretched, very vexed
with himself at that stupid swelling from his heart to
his throat that forbade him speech.
</p>

<p>
"Would you be living in?" he was asked.
</p>

<p>
"I think I should be out all day."
</p>

<p>
"Jus' breakfast and supper?  That's the usual, of
course, isn't it?  And full Sundays.  That would be
twelve shillings."
</p>

<p>
Twelve shillings was to be his wage from Mr. Pennyquick.
He could not spend it all.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't pay it," said Mr. Wriford and caught at
the counter to assist himself to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am sorry, I'm sure," said the woman, and
she added: "Hadn't you better rest a little?"
</p>

<p>
His difficulty in rising warned him that if he did get
up he might be unable to stand.  "I will, just a
moment," he told her, "if you don't mind.  It's very kind
of you.  I've had rather a long day."
</p>

<p>
She had said she was sorry, and she stood looking at
him as though she were genuinely grieved and more than
a little disturbed in mind.  "How much could you
pay?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"I could pay ten."
</p>

<p>
"And when might you want to begin?"
</p>

<p>
"Now."
</p>

<p>
"Would it be for long?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't say.  I don't think it would."
</p>

<p>
She said briskly, as though her obvious disturbance
of mind had dictated a sudden course, "Look here,
jus' wait a minute, will you?" and went into the
parlour, closing the door behind her.
</p>

<p>
Murmur of voices.
</p>

<p>
"You know," she said, coming back to him, "if it
was likely to be regular perhaps we could arrange ten
shillings.  But not knowing, you see, that's awkward.
We like our lodger more to be one of us like.  We don't
want the jus' come and go sort.  That's how it stands,
you see.  You couldn't say, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very kind of you," said Mr. Wriford.  "I'm
afraid I can't.  I'll tell you.  I'm engaged with
Mr. Pennyquick at Tower House School&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Pennyquick!"
</p>

<p>
"You know him, I expect?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know Mr. Pennyquick," said the woman, and
seemed to have some meaning in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's only for a week, or by the week.  I can't
say how long."
</p>

<p>
He was given no reply to this.  It was as if mention
of Mr. Pennyquick's name placed him as very likely
to be among the "come and go sort."  "I had better
be going, I think," he said, and this time got to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am sorry," the woman said again.  "I'm
sure I'm very sorry, and you know I can't say straight
off where you'll get what you want for ten shillings.
There's places, of course.  But you know you don't
look fit to go trudging round after them this time of
night.  Hadn't you better go just for the night
somewhere?  There's Mrs. Winter I think would take you
for the night.  She's at&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford went to the door.  "You needn't
trouble," he said weakly.  "It can't be by the night.  I
can only pay at the end of the week."
</p>

<p>
The woman gave a little sound of dismay.  "But&mdash;do
you mean no money till then?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded.  That was what he meant&mdash;and must face.
</p>

<p>
"But, dearie me, you won't find any will take you
without deposit.  They're very suspicious here, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Mr. Wriford.  "Well&mdash;" and with
fingers as helpless as his voice began to fumble at the
latch.
</p>

<p>
"But where are you going?"
</p>

<p>
"This handle," he said.  "It's rather stiff."  He took
his hand from it as she came round the counter to him,
then immediately caught at it again and supported
himself against it.
</p>

<p>
She saw the action and cried out in consternation.
"Oh," she cried.  "Why, you can't hardly stand, and
going off nowhere!  Why, you jus' can't.  You'll have
to stop."
</p>

<p>
He asked wearily: "Stop!  How can I stop?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, ten shillings.  That'll be all right.  Our
Essie, you know&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He could say no more than "Thank you.  Thank you."
</p>

<p>
"You'll come right along.  We're just sitting down
to supper.  No, I'll just tell them first."
</p>

<p>
He effected speech again as, with her last words, she
went to the parlour door.  "But deposit," he said, and
recalled the phrase she had used.  "Aren't you
suspicious?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that can't be helped," she smiled back at
him.  "Our Essie, you know, she'd never forgive me
if I sent you off like you are.  Jus' sit down."
</p>

<p>
He had scarcely taken a seat when she was back
again and calling him from the threshold of the open
parlour door.  "That's all right.  Come right along.
You didn't give your name, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"Wriford," and he reached her where she stood
smiling.
</p>

<p>
She turned within and announced him: "Well,
here's our lodger.  That's Mr. Bickers."
</p>

<p>
A man of stature and of strength, once, this
Hy. Bickers, Cert. Plumber.  Bent now and stooping, but
with something very strong, very confident in his face:
lined and worn as his wife's, silvery as hers.  Slightly
whiskered, of white, otherwise clean shaven.  A smoking-cap
on his head.  Little enough hair beneath it.  In his
face that same suggestion of a very happy secret happiness.
"Expect you're tired," said Mr. Bickers and gave
a warm hand-clasp.
</p>

<p>
"And that's our Essie."
</p>

<p>
A very cool, vigorous young hand, this time, that
grasped Mr. Wriford's and shook it strongly.  A slim,
brown little thing, our Essie, eighteen perhaps, very
pretty, with extraordinarily bright eyes; wearing a blue
cotton dress with white spots.
</p>

<p>
"Pleased to meet you," said Essie.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Such a cheerful, jolly room, the parlour.  Here was
a round table set out for supper, and Essie bustling in
and out of what appeared to be the kitchen, giving final
touches and laying a fourth place.  A great number of
framed texts all round the walls, with two or three
religious pictures, a highly coloured portrait of Queen
Victoria and another of General Booth.  A bright little
fire burning, with an armchair of shining American
cloth on each side of it, and a sofa and chairs, similarly
covered, all with antimacassars, set around the room.
A bookcase near the window, and near one armchair
a little table carrying an immense Bible with other
Bibles and prayer-books placed upon it.  Some shells
on the mantelpiece in front of an immense, gilt-framed
mirror, and with them a great number of cups and
saucers and vases all inscribed as "A present from" the
place whence they were purchased.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford sat on the sofa, silent, better already
from the warmth and the fragrant savour from the
kitchen; not less wretched though: somehow more
wretched, somehow overcome and utterly consumed
with that swelling feeling from his heart to his throat.
Mr. Bickers sat in one of the armchairs, silent.
Mrs. Bickers in the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers appears.  "Now Essie, dear, I'll dish
up.  You jus' look after the lodger, dear.  I expect the
lodger will like to wash his hands.  Hot water, dear,
and there's his bundle."
</p>

<p>
Essie comes out of the kitchen with a steaming jug
in one hand and a candle in the other, puts down the
candle to tuck Mr. Wriford's parcel under her arm, and
then takes it up again.  "This way," says Essie and
leads the way through another door and up a flight of
very steep and very narrow stairs.  "Aren't they steep,
though?" says Essie over her shoulder.  "We don't
half want a lift!"
</p>

<p>
The stairs give onto a passage with doors leading off
from the right, and the passage terminates in a door
which Essie butts open with her knee, and here is a
bedroom.  "This is the lodger's room," says Essie,
setting down the candle and then removing the jug
from the basin and pouring out the water.  "Course it
don't look much jus' at present, not expecting you,
you see.  But I'll pop up after supper an' put it to rights.
Find your way down, can't you?  I'll get you a bit of
soap out of my room to go on with."  There is a second
door to the bedroom, and Essie goes through it and
returns with soap.  "That's my room," says Essie.
"I call this my dressing-room when we haven't got a
lodger, jus' like as if I was a duchess," and she gives the
bright laugh that Mr. Wriford had heard in the shop.
"That's all right then.  Bring the candle.  That mark
on the wall there's where a lodger left his candle burning
all night.  Oh, they're cautions, some of our lodgers!
Don't be long."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
Most savoury and most welcome soup opens the
supper.  After it a shoulder of mutton, Essie doing all
the helping and the carving and the running about.
She sits opposite Mr. Wriford.  Her eyes&mdash;there is
something quite extraordinarily bright about her eyes
as he watches them.  They are never still.  They are for
ever sparkling from this object to that; and wherever
momentarily they rest he sees them sparkle anew and
sees her soft lips twitch as though from where her eyes
alight a hundred merry fancies run sparkling to her
mind.  Her eyes flicker over the dish of potatoes and
rest there a moment, and there they are sparkling, and
her mouth twitching, as though she is recalling comic
passages in buying them or in cooking them, or perhaps
it is their very appearance, grotesquely fat and
helpless, heaped one upon the other, in which she sees
something odd that tickles her.  Most extraordinarily bright
eyes, and with them always most funny little compressions
of her lips, as if she is for ever tickled onto the
very brink of breaking into laughter.
</p>

<p>
This at last, indeed, she does.  Presence of the new
lodger seems to throw a constraint about the table, and
the meal is eaten almost to the end of the mutton course
in complete silence.  Very startling, therefore, when
Essie suddenly drops her knife and fork with a clatter
and leans back in her chair, eyes all agleam.  "Oh,
dear me!" cries Essie, as Mr. and Mrs. Bickers stare at
her.  "Oh, dear me!  I'm very sorry, but just munching
like this, you know, all of us, without speaking a word!
Oh, dear!" and she uses the expression that Mr. Wriford
had heard when he first spoke to Mrs. Bickers.  "Oh,
dear, let's have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers glances at Mr. Wriford and says reprovingly:
"Oh, Essie!"  But there is no help for it and no
avoiding its infection.  Essie puts back her head and
goes into a ring of the brightest possible laughter, and
Mrs. Bickers laughs at her, and Mr. Bickers laughs at
her, and even Mr. Wriford smiles; and thereafter Essie
chatters without ceasing to her parents on an extraordinary
variety of topics connected with what she has done
or seen during the day, in every one of which she finds
subject for amusement and many times declares of
whatever it may be: "Oh, aren't they funny, though!
Let's have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford smiles when she laughs&mdash;impossible
to avoid it.  Otherwise he contributes nothing to the
chatter.  This strange, this kind and happy and generous
ending to his day, acts upon him only in increasing
sensation of that upward swelling from his heart to his
throat that forbids him speech.  He has the feeling that
if he talks his voice will break in tears&mdash;of weakness,
of wretchedness: nay, of worse than these&mdash;of their
very apotheosis.  There is happiness here.  There is
here, among these three, that which he is seeking, seeking
and cannot find.  They have found it: what is it then?
It is all about them&mdash;shining in their faces, singing in
their words.  He is not of it.  He is outside it.  They are
on the heights; he in the depths, the depths!  Let him
not speak, let him not speak!  If he speaks he must sob
and cry, get to his feet, while wondering they look at
him, and stare at them, and break from them and go.
If he so betrays himself he must cry at them: "What
have you found?  Why are you happy?  This kills me,
kills me, to sit here and watch you.  Don't touch me.
None of you touch me.  Let me go.  Just let me go."
</p>

<p>
They seem to see his plight.  They smile encouragingly
at him to draw him into their talk; Mr. Bickers,
when the women are clearing away, offers him a new clay
pipe and the tobacco jar.  But they seem to understand.
They accept without comment or offence the negation
of these advances which he gives only by shaking his
head as they are made.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's done!" says Essie, coming down from
the lodger's room after the supper has been cleared away.
"Bed made and everything nice and ready.  One of the
castors of the bed is shaky, Dad.  You'll have to see
to it in the morning.  I can't think how I never noticed
it till now.  Oh, those lodgers!  They're fair cautions!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers smiles at Mr. Wriford.  "Well, I expect
you'd like to go straight to bed, wouldn't you now?"
</p>

<p>
Painful this distrust of his voice.  He rises and
manages: "Yes, I would."
</p>

<p>
"You'll be ever so much better in the morning after a
good sleep.  What about&mdash;" and Mrs. Bickers looks
at her husband.
</p>

<p>
"It's our custom," says Mr. Bickers in his deep
voice, "all to read a piece from the Bible before we go
to bed&mdash;all that sleep under this roof.  We'll do it now
so you can get along.  Essie, dear."
</p>

<p>
Essie puts chairs to the table, and then Bibles.  The
immense Bible for Mr. Bickers, one but a little smaller
for Mrs. Bickers, and one for herself.  "There's my
Church-service for you," says Essie to Mr. Wriford.
All the Bibles have a ribbon depending from them
whereat they are opened, and Essie finds the place for
Mr. Wriford.  "Twenty-fourth Psalm," says Essie.
"My fav'rit.  Isn't it a short one, though!"
</p>

<p>
"We read in turn," says Mr. Bickers.  He has one
hand on the great Bible and stretches the other to
Mrs. Bickers, who takes it and holds it.  Mr. Wriford sits
opposite them, then Essie, next her father on his other
side and snuggling against him, and they begin.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bickers, very deep and slow and reverent:
</p>

<p>
"<i>The earth is the Lord's and all that therein is: the
compass of the world and they that dwell therein.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers, very gently:
</p>

<p>
"<i>For he hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared
it upon the floods.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford.  He is trembling, trembling, trembling.
They are waiting for him.  They are looking at him.
Round swings the room, around and around.  Who is
waiting?  Who is looking?  Others are here.  He hears
the oldest sea-captain living, plainly as if he stood before
him in the room: "Matey!  Matey!"  He sees
Mr. Puddlebox, plainly as if he were here beside him.
"Wedge in, boy; wedge in!" They are surely here.
They are surely calling him.  He is on the rock with the
sea about him.  He is in the little room with the figure
on the bed.  Darkness, darkness.  Is this Puddlebox?
Is this Captain?  Is he by the sea?  Is he by the bed?
Round swings the darkness, around and around.  He is
not!  He is here!  He is here where happiness is.  They
are waiting for him.  They are watching him.  Wriford!
Wriford!  He tries to read the words that swim before
his eyes.  He must.  They are very few.  They are a
question.  He must!  Trembling he gives voice:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who
shall rise up in his holy place?</i>"
</p>

<p>
Essie, strong and clear and eager, emphasising the
first word as though strongly and directly she answered
him:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Even he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart:
and that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn
to deceive his neighbour.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bickers, as one that feels the words he reads,
and is sure of them:
</p>

<p>
"<i>He shall receive the blessing from the Lord: and
righteousness from the God of his salvation.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers in gentle confirmation:
</p>

<p>
"<i>This is the generation of them that seek him: even of
them that seek thy face, O Jacob.</i>"
</p>

<p>
His turn again.  He cannot!  Let him get out of this!
Let him away!  This is not to be borne.  Unendurable
this.  What are they reading?  Why have they chosen
these words.  "Who shall ascend?"  They know his
misery, then!  They know the depths that he is in!
Hateful that they should know it, hateful, insufferable,
horrible.  They see his state and have chosen words
that mean his state.  He is exposed before them.  Let
him away!  Let him get out of this!  They shall not
know!  His turn.  He cannot, cannot.  They are
watching.  They are waiting.  Do they see how his face is
working?  Do they see how he twists and twists his
hands?  His turn.  Ah, ah, he is in the depths, the
depths!  He is physically, actually down, down&mdash;struggling,
gasping, suffocating.  All this room and these
about him stand as it were above him&mdash;watching him,
waiting for him, knowing his misery.  He is sinking,
sinking.  He is in black and whirling darkness.  There
is shouting in his ears.  Let him away!  Let him go!
</p>

<p>
Some one says: "Essie, dear."
</p>

<p>
Essie&mdash;strong and loud and clear, with tremendous
emphasis upon the first word as though her strong young
voice performed its meaning:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye
everlasting doors: and the King of glory shall come in.</i>"
</p>

<p>
He gets to his feet, overturning his chair.  He stumbles
away, with blind eyes, with groping hands.
</p>

<p>
"Not that door!" cries Essie and runs to him.
"Here's the door.  Here's the stairs.  Look, here's
your candle."
</p>

<p>
He blunders up.  He blunders to his room.  He
extinguishes the candle.  Let him have the dark, the
dark!  He throws off his clothes, tearing them from him
as though they were his agonies.  God, if he could but
tear these tortures so!  He flings himself upon the bed
and trembles there and clutches there and thrusts the
sheet between his teeth to stay him crying aloud.
Inchoate thoughts that rend him, rend him!  Unmeaning
cries that with the sheet he stifles.  What, what
consumes him now?  He cannot name it.  What tortures
him?  He does not know.  Writhe, writhe in the bed;
and now it is the sea, and now the Infirmary ward, and
now the coffee-shop, and now the parlour.  Ah, beat
down, beat down these torments!  Ah, sit up and stare
into the darkness and rid the spirit, rid the mind, of all
these shapes and scenes that press about the pillow.
Has he slept?  Is he sleeping?  Why suffers he?  What
racks him?  In God's name what?  In pity, in pity
what?
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
everlasting doors: and the King of glory shall come in.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Ah, ah!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
TRIAL OF MR. WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
He had determined, writhing in those tortures of that
night, at daybreak to get out of it.  He had promised
himself, striving to subdue his mental torments, that
early morning, the house not yet astir, should see him
up and begone.  Sleep betrayed him his promises and
his resolves.  While he writhed and while he cried aloud
to sleep to come and rest his fevered writhings, she would
not be won.  Towards morning she came to him.  He
awoke to find daylight, sounds about the house, escape
impossible.
</p>

<p>
His reception at breakfast in the little parlour changed
his intention.  His reception made the desertion that
now he intended immediately he could leave the house
as impossible as, now he saw, escape at daybreak had
been most base.  He found in Mr. and Mrs. Bickers
and in Essie not the smallest trace of recognition that
his conduct upon the previous evening had been in the
smallest degree remiss.  He found them proving in
innumerable little ways that, as Mrs. Bickers had told
him, they liked their lodgers to be "one of us
like."  Mr. Bickers proposes to walk with him towards Tower
House School in order to show him short cuts that will
lessen the way by five minutes.  Mrs. Bickers inquires
if she may go through his bundle to see if any buttons
or any darnings are required.  Overnight he had been
made to put on a pair of Mr. Bickers' slippers.  Essie
has put a new lace in one of his boots because one, when
she was polishing the boots, was "worn out a fair
treat."  How can he run away from them without paying them
in face of such kindness and confidence as all this?
"Glad you like bacon," says Essie, helping him
generously from the steaming dish she brings from the
kitchen; and says to her mother: "Haven't some of our
lodgers bin fanciful, though?  Oh, we haven't half had
some cautions!" and her eyes sparkle and her lips
twitch as though her merry mind is running over the
entertainment that some of the cautions have given.
</p>

<p>
No, there can be no desertion of his duties here after
this.  They trust him.  They accept him as "one of
us like."  Already he is indebted to them.  Until the
week is out he is penniless and unable to repay them.
When his week is up he can thank them and pay them
and go.  Till then, at whatever cost&mdash;and he will
stiffen himself for the future; he was ill and
overwrought last night&mdash;he must stay and earn and settle
for the week for which he is committed.
</p>

<p>
"Ready?" says Mr. Bickers.  "Time we was moving now."
</p>

<p>
Yes, he is quite ready.  Essie runs to the shop door
to open it for them.  Mrs. Bickers comes with them to
see them off.  Some cows are being driven down the
street.  Essie stops with hand on the door to watch
them.  "Now, Essie," says Mr. Bickers.  Two cows
lumber onto the pavement.  Mr. Wriford sees Essie's
eyes sparkling and her lips twitching as she watches.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bickers again: "Now, Essie dear&mdash;Essie!"
</p>

<p>
But Essie still watches.  "Oh, jus' look at them!"
says Essie with a little squirm of her shoulders and then
turns round: "Aren't cows funny, though?  Let's
have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
There is nothing at all to laugh at that any of the
waiting three can see&mdash;except at Essie.  Essie laughs
as though cows were indeed the very funniest things in
the world, and her laugh is impossible of resistance.
Mr. Bickers is smiling as they start down the street,
and Mr. Wriford is smiling also.
</p>

<p>
"She's such a bright one, our Essie," says Mr. Bickers.
</p>

<p>
"You must be very fond of her," says Mr. Wriford&mdash;"You
and Mrs. Bickers;" and Mr. Bickers replies
simply: "Why, I reckon our Essie is all the world to
us."
</p>

Mr. Wriford suits Mr. Pennyquick.  Mr. Pennyquick,
indeed, as Mr. Wriford finds, is suited by anybody
and anything that permits him leisure in which
to nurse his ailment.  His ailment requires rest which
he takes all day long on the sofa in his study; and his
ailment requires divers cordials which he keeps handily
within reach in long bottles under the sofa.  He is an
outdoor man, as he tells Mr. Wriford when Mr. Wriford
comes into the study on some inquiry.  He is all for
the open air and for sports; he only missed a double
Blue at Cambridge&mdash;Rugby football and cross-country
running&mdash;through rank favouritism, and he can't
bear to be seen taking physic.  To look around his
room, says he, you'd never think he was a regular
drug-shop inside owing to these rotten doctors, would you?
Not a bottle of the muck to be seen anywhere.  That's
because, says he, his breath exuding the muck in
pungent volumes, he hides the bottles through sheer
sensitiveness.  He's feeling a wee bit brighter this
afternoon, thank goodness, and if Wriford, like a good chap,
would just start the First Form in their Caesar he'll
be in in about two ticks and take them over.
</p>

<p>
Poor fellow, he never does manage to get in in two
ticks or in any more considerable circumference of the
clock.  Mr. Wriford, as he closes the study door, hears
the chink of bottle and glass and knows that the open-air
man will breathe no other air than that of his room
until he is able to grip his malady sufficiently to stagger
up to bed.
</p>

<p>
The trial week, indeed, is not many days old before
Mr. Wriford obtains a pretty clear comprehension of
the state of affairs at the Tower House and the
reputation of its Headmaster.  "Pennyquick!  Whiskyquick,
I call him," says Essie; and though her mother
reproves this levity, and though ill-natured gossip has
no exercise in the Bickers' establishment, even the
cert. plumber and his wife admit that the school is not what
it was, and speak of a time when there were forty or
fifty boys and several resident masters.  There are only
twenty-four boys now&mdash;all boarders.  There are no
day-boarders.  The town knows its Mr. Pennyquick;
and the time cannot be far distant when the tradesmen
in different parts of the county, now attracted by the
past reputation of this "School for the Sons of
Gentlemen," also will know him for what he is.  Six boys
left the Tower House at the end of the previous term;
five are leaving at the end of this.  They are sorry to
go, Mr. Wriford finds, and at first rather wonders at
the fact.  But the reason is clear before even the trial
week is out.  The reason is that these twenty-four young
Sons of Gentlemen, dejected-looking as he had seen
them at play when he accosted Mr. Pennyquick, are
dejected also in spirit&mdash;morally abased, that is to say,
partly as coming from homes too snobbish to commit
them to the rough and tumble of local elementary or
grammar schools, and partly as being received into
the atmosphere emanated by their Headmaster at the
Tower House.  They like the school.  It suits them,
and therefore, wiser than they should be, they carry
no tales to their parents.  They like the school.  They
like the utter slackness and slovenliness of the place.
There is no discipline.  There is scarcely a pretence
of education.  They wash in the mornings not till after
they are dressed, Mr. Wriford finds, and they do not
appear to wash again all day.  They are thoroughly
afraid of Mr. Pennyquick, but he scarcely ever visits
them, leaving them now entirely to Mr. Wriford as
formerly he left them to Mr. Wriford's predecessors
who seemed to have been much of a habit of mind and
character with themselves.  Domestic arrangements
are looked after by Mr. Pennyquick's mother who is
a little, frightened grey wisp of a woman with hands
that shake like her son's, but shake for him and
because of him, Mr. Wriford discovers, not as a result of
similar ailment and remedy.  She adores her son.  She
is terrified of him.  She is terrified for him.  She sees
his livelihood and his manhood crumbling away,
simultaneously and disastrously swift, and what she can
do, by befoolment of parents in correspondence relative
to her son's ill-health and their own son's happiness
and success, by pathetic would-be befoolment of
Mr. Wriford on the same counts, and by lenient treatment of
the pupils, that does she daily and hourly to avert
the doom she sees.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Within the first days of the trial week Mr. Wriford's
duties fall into a regular routine.  This is his trial week,
his temporary week, a week in which he comes to his
duties overwrought, shaken, uncertain and, thus
conditioned, is wretched in his performance of them.
Shortly before nine he presents himself at Tower House.
The boys are wandering dejectedly about the
playground.  He passes nervously through them&mdash;they
do not raise their caps&mdash;and hides from them in the
schoolroom till the hour strikes on a neighbouring
church clock.  Then Mr. Wriford rings a large hand-bell,
and the boys drift in at their leisure and take their
places on the benches.  Sometimes, before Mr. Wriford
has finished ringing, Mr. Pennyquick, in gown and
untasselled mortar-board, comes charging across the
playground from the house, and there is then an alarmed
stampede on the part of the boys to get in before him
or to crowd in immediately upon his heels.  Sometimes
there is a very long wait before the appearance of the
Headmaster; and Mr. Wriford, nervously irresolute
as to whether to ring again or to begin school without
him, stands wretched and self-conscious at his raised
desk while the boys titter and whisper, or throw paper
pellets, or look at him and&mdash;he knows&mdash;titter and
whisper at his expense.  This is his trial week, his
temporary week.  He is much overwrought in body and
in mind.  He does not know what authority he should
show or how to show it.  He hesitates till too late to
interfere with one outburst of horse-play or of giggling.
At the next he hesitates in doubt as to whether, having
overlooked the former, he can attempt to subdue this.
While he hesitates, and while the noise increases, and
while the humiliation and wretchedness it causes him
increase&mdash;in the midst of all this Mr. Pennyquick
charges in.  Mr. Pennyquick is either unshaved and
looking the worse for it; or he has shaved and has cut
himself and dabs angrily at little tufts of cotton wool
that decorate his chin.
</p>

<p>
"Anderson!" barks Mr. Pennyquick, seizing the
roll-call book and a pencil but not looking at the one
or using the other.  "Adsum," responds Anderson;
and Mr. Pennyquick barks through the roll, which he
knows by heart, much as if he were a sheep-dog with
each boy a sheep and each name a bark or a bite in
pursuit of it.  He does not wait for responses.  He
barks along in a jumble of explosions, interspersed with
a jumble of squeaked replies; punctuated at intervals,
as if it were part of the roll, by a very much louder bark
in the form of a fierce "SPEAK UP!" and concluded
by a rush without pause into prayers&mdash;Mr. Pennyquick
plumping suddenly upon his knees, much as if the
sheepdog had suddenly hurled itself upon the flock, and the
first portion of the devotions being lost in the din of
his pupils extricating themselves from their desks in
order to follow his example, much as if the flock had
responded by a panic stampede in every direction.
</p>

<p>
"Samuel Major," barks Mr. Pennyquick, as if he
were biting that young gentleman.  "'Sum!" squeaks
Samuel Major, as if he were bitten.
"Minorsum - Smithsum - Stoopersum - Taylorsum&mdash;SPEAK
UP!&mdash;Tooveysum - Westsum - Whitesum&mdash;SPEAK
UP!&mdash;Williamssum - Wintersum - Woodsum -
Ourfatherchartinheavenhallo'edbeth'name ... Amen&mdash;SPEAK
UP!&mdash;mightyanmosmercifulfatherwethynunworthyservants
... Amen&mdash;SPEAK UP!"
</p>

<p>
The schoolroom is divided by a red baize curtain
into two parts.  The scholars are divided into three
forms of which Form One is the highest.  Mr. Pennyquick,
who knows the time-table of lessons by heart
just as he knows the roll-call, follows the last Amen
with a last "SPEAK UP!" and is himself followed in
haste and trepidation by the members of Form One
as he jumps from his knees and charges through the
curtain barking "Form One.  Thursday.  Euclid.
Blackboard.  Come round the blackboard.  Last
night's prep?"
</p>

<p>
"Twelfth proposition, sir," squeaks the boy whose
eye he has caught.
</p>

<p>
This&mdash;or the same point in whatever else the
subject may be&mdash;invariably marks the end of Mr. Pennyquick's
early morning energy.  He begins to draw on
the blackboard or to find the place in a text-book.  The
energy goes, or the recollection of his medicine begins,
and he changes his mind and barks: "Revise last
night's prep!"  There is a stampede to the desks and a
burying in books.  The Headmaster paces the room
between the wall and the curtain, barking a "WORK UP!"
at intervals and hesitating a little longer each time he
turns at the curtain.  "WORK UP!" and he comes
charging through towards Mr. Wriford and the door.
"Keep an eye on Form One, Wriford.  Draw the curtain.
I'm not quite the thing this morning.  Take them
on for me if I'm not back in ten minutes, will you?  I
ought to be in bed, you know.  I shan't be long.
WORK UP!"
</p>

<p>
He is gone.  He rarely appears again.  If he appears
it is when clearly he is not quite the thing and is only
to skirmish a few times up and down the schoolroom
to the tune of "WORK UP!  WORK UP!" or to show
himself on the playing-field, bellow "PLAY UP!" and
betake himself again to the treatment of his complaint.
</p>

<p>
He is gone.  Mr. Wriford is left with all the three
forms in his charge.  It is his trial week.  He does not
know what authority he should show or how to show it.
He does not know what has been learnt or what is being
learnt, and he is cunningly or cheekily frustrated at
every attempt to discover it.  In whatever way he
attempts to set work afoot an excuse is found to stop him.
By one boy he is told that "please, sir," they do not do
this, and by another that "please, sir," they have never
done the other.  He has neither sufficient strength of
himself nor sufficient certainty of his position to insist.
Without advice, without support, he is left very much
at the mercy of the three forms, and they show him
none.  While he tries to settle one form it is under the
distractions and the interruptions of the other two.
When he turns to one of these the first joins the third in
idleness and disorder.  At eleven o'clock he is informed
"Please, sir, we have our break now," and there is a
stampede for the door without awaiting his assent.
Similarly at half-past twelve, when morning school ends,
and similarly again at four and at half-past seven, which
are the terminations of afternoon school and of evening
preparation.  There is no asking his permission.  His
position is exactly summarised by this&mdash;that the boys
know the rules and customs, he does not; and further
by this&mdash;that while he remains miserably uncertain of
the extent of his authority and of how he should assert
it, they, by that very uncertainty, well estimate its
limits and hourly, with each advantage gained, more
narrowly confine it, more openly defy him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
At one o'clock there is lunch.  Sometimes Mr. Pennyquick
is present as the boys assemble, and then they
assemble in timid silence and eat with due regard to
manners.  Sometimes he does not appear till midway
through the meal, till when there is greedy and noisy
and slovenly behaviour, which frightened-looking
Mrs. Pennyquick attempts occasionally to check with a
timid: "Hush, boys," or upon which she looks with
nervously indulgent smiles.  There is painfully evident
in all her dealings with the boys a dread amounting to
a lively terror that anything shall be done to displease
them.  Mr. Wriford soon realises that her hourly fear
is of a boy writing home anything that may lead to
parental inquiry and thence to the disclosure of her
son's affliction.  In out-of-school hours she frequently
visits the schoolroom and looks anxiously at any boy
who may be engaged in writing.  Mr. Wriford at first
wonders why.  He understands when one day, passing
behind a boy thus occupied, she stops and says:
"Writing home, Charlie?  That's a good boy.  Do tell your
father that Mr. Pennyquick only this morning was
telling me what a good boy you are at your lessons and how
well you are getting on.  Write a nice letter, dear.
Would you like to come with me a minute and see if
I can find some sweeties in my cupboard?  Come along,
then."
</p>

<p>
With like purpose it is in fearful apprehension that
she watches her son's face and his every movement when
he is at the luncheon table.  Mr. Wriford sees her look
up with face in agony of misgiving when the Headmaster
comes in late, sees her eyes ever upon him in
constant dread as he sits opposite her at the head of
the table.  There does not appear great cause for
nervousness.  As a rule the Headmaster sits glowering and
glum and fires off no more than, his own plate being
empty, an occasional "EAT UP!"  Sometimes he is
boisterously cheerful.  Whatever his mood he never
omits one very satisfactory tribute to his own
principles in which his mother joins very happily and
impressively.  It takes this form.  Immediately
Mr. Pennyquick sits down he calls in a very loud voice for
the water to be passed to him.  He then fills his glass
from such a great height as to make all the boys laugh,
then drinks, then sets down the tumbler with a sharp
rap, and then says to Mr. Wriford: "I don't know if
you're a beer-drinker, Wriford, but I'm afraid we can't
indulge you here.  I never touch anything but water
myself.  I attribute every misery, every failure in life,
to drink, and I will allow it in no shape or form beneath
my roof.  I can give no man a better motto than my own
motto: Stick to Water!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Pennyquick then drinks again with great
impressiveness, and Mrs. Pennyquick at once cries: "Boys,
listen to that!  Always remember what Mr. Pennyquick
says and always say it was Mr. Pennyquick who told
you.  Stick to Water is Mr. Pennyquick's motto, and
he never, never allows drink in any shape or form
beneath his roof.  Why, do you know&mdash;I must tell them
this, dear&mdash;a doctor once ordered Mr. Pennyquick
just a small glass of wine once a day, and Mr. Pennyquick
said to him: 'Doctor, I know I'm very ill; but
if wine is the only thing to save me, then, doctor, I must
die, for wine I do not and will not touch.'"
</p>

<p>
All eyes in great admiration on this unflinching
champion of hydropathy, who modestly concludes the scene
with a loud: "EAT UP!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
V
</h4>

<p>
Afternoon school, in its idleness, inattention, and
indiscipline, is a repetition of the morning.  Preparation
from six to half-past seven again discovers irresolution,
uncertainty and wretchedness set in the midst of those
who by every device increase it and advantage themselves
from it.  At four o'clock it is Mr. Wriford's duty
to keep an eye on the boys while they disport themselves
in the field where he had first seen them; at half-past
five is tea; at shortly before eight Mr. Wriford is
making his way to where supper awaits in the cheerful
parlour behind the little shop of the cert. plumber.
</p>

<p>
Thither he goes through the darkness; and, as one in
darkness that gropes for light, can see no light, and
dreads the sudden leap of some assault, so trembles he
among the dark oppressions of his mind.
</p>

<p>
These are evenings of early summer, and they have
early summer's dusky veils draped down from starry
skies.  Her pleasant scents they have, her gentle airs,
her after-hush of all her daylight choirs.  They but
enfever Mr. Wriford.  Her young nights, these, that
not arrest her days but softly steal about her, finger on
lip attend her while she sleeps, then snatch their filmy
coverlets while eastward she rubs her smiling eyes,
springs from her slumber, breaks into music all her
morning hymns, and up and all about in sudden radiance
rides, rides in maiden loveliness.  Ah, not for him!
</p>

<p>
These are young nights that greet him as he leaves
the school.  In much affliction he cries out upon their
stilly peace.  Look, here that new year in summer is,
her peace, her happiness attained, that from the windows
of the ward at Pendra he had watched blown here and
there, mocked, trampled on, caught by the throat and
thrust beneath the iron ground in variance with winter's
jealousy.  In her he had envisaged his own stress.
Look, here she reigns in happy peace, in ordered quiet:
he?
</p>

<p>
He moans a little as he walks.  There is something
in life that he has missed, and to its discovery he
can bring no more than this&mdash;that it rests not in
violent disregard of what happens to him or what he
does, for that he has proved empty; nor rests in the
ease that, by communication with London, might be
his, for that inflicts return to the old self, hatred and
fear of whom had driven him away.  Where then?  And
then it is he moans.  His mind presents him none but
these alternatives; his mind, when miserably he rejects
them, threateningly turns them upon him in forms of
fear.  "Well, you have got to live," his mind threatens
him.  "To-morrow you shall perhaps be turned out
from this post at the school.  You will have to face anew
some means of life; you will have to suffer what has to
be suffered in that part; face men and submit to their
treatment of such as you, or face them and find
fierceness sufficient to defy them."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" he cries.  "No, no!"  He fears his powers
of endurance, fears that beneath those trials he will be
driven back to where is turned upon him the other
threat.  "Well, you must go back," his thoughts
threaten him.  "Money and comfort await you in
London for your asking.  You must go back to what
you were.  Live at ease in seclusion, if you will; ah,
with your old way of life to tell you hourly that now
it has you chained&mdash;that now you have tried escape,
proved it impossible, and never again can escape it!"
</p>

<p>
He cries aloud: "No, no!" He moans for his abject
hopelessness.  He trembles for his fears at these his
threats.  Under his misery he wanders away from the
direction of the little plumber's shop, hating to enter
it and to its brightness expose his suffering; under his
fears he hastens to it, clinging to this present occupation
lest, losing it, one of the threats that threaten him
unsheaths its sword upon him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
When, by these vacillations, he is late for the supper
hour, Essie will be at the shop door watching for him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, aren't you half late, though!" cries Essie.  "I
was jus' goin' to dish up.  Oh, you lodgers, you know,
you're fair cautions!"
</p>

<p>
"I was kept late," he says.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you weren't half walking slow when you come
round the corner, though."  She sees his face more
clearly in the light of the shop and she says: "Oh,
dear, you don't look half tired!  My steak-and-kidney
pudding, that's what you want!  Here he is, Dad!  Get
his slippers, Mother?  That old Whiskyquick's been fair
tiring him out!"
</p>

<p>
She runs to the kitchen and in a minute calls out:
"All ready?  Oh, it's cooked a fair treat!"  She bears
in the steaming steak-and-kidney pudding, sets it on the
table, but stops while above the bubbling crust she
poises her knife and watches it with her little twitches
of her lips and with her sparkling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Essie," says Mrs. Bickers.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't it funny, though," says Essie, "all
bubbling and squeaking!  Let's have a laugh!"

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
MARTYRDOM OF MASTER CUPPER
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
It is by a very surprising and extraordinary event
that, from the abyss of wretchedness, irresolution and
humiliation of the trial week at Tower House School,
Mr. Wriford finds himself lifted to the plane of its
extension by week and week of ever increasing stability
and assurance; finds himself suiting Mr. Pennyquick;
finds himself in a new phase in which there develop new
emotions.
</p>

<p>
This event is no less remarkable, no less apparently
cataclysmal to his position in the school and to the
school itself, than a tremendous box upon the ear which,
early in his second week, Mr. Wriford administers to a
First Form pupil whose name is Cupper and whose face
is fat and dark and cunning.
</p>

<p>
Morning school, very shortly after the Headmaster
with a loud "WORK UP!" has left his class "for ten
minutes," is the hour of this amazement.  A week's
experience of the new assistant-master has opened to
the pupils unbounded lengths of impertinence and
indiscipline to which they can go; and the door has no
sooner banged behind Mr. Pennyquick than they
proceed to explore them..
</p>

<p>
A favourite form of this sport is to badger Mr. Wriford
with requests, and it is done the more noisily and
impertinently by strict observation of the rule established
in all schools on the point.  At once, that is to
say, Mr. Pennyquick having left the room, there
uprises a forest of arms, a universal snapping of fingers
and thumbs, and a chorus that grows to a babel of:
"Please, sir!  Please, sir!  Please, sir!"
</p>

<p>
One "Please, sir" is that there is no ink, another to
borrow a knife to sharpen a pencil, another to find a
book, another to open a window, another to shut it.
Mr. Wriford tries to pick out a particular request and
to answer it; he calls for silence and is responded to
with louder "Please, sirs!"  He thinks to stop the din
by ignoring it, turns his back upon the noise and cleans
the blackboard, and this is the signal for changing the
note to a general wail of: "Oh, please, sir!&mdash;Oh,
please, sir!&mdash;Oh, please, sir!"
</p>

<p>
Master Cupper carries the sport to a length hitherto
unattempted.  Master Cupper rises to his feet and with
snapping finger and thumb calls very loudly: "Please,
sir!  Please, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, Cupper!"
</p>

<p>
"But, please, sir; please, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down!" and Mr. Wriford turns again to the
blackboard.  He is quite aware, though he cannot see,
what is happening.  He knows that Cupper has left
his place and is approaching him with uplifted hand and
persistent "Please, sir!"  He knows that Cupper is
close behind him and, from the laughter, that doubtless
he is misbehaving immediately behind his back.  He
turns and catches Cupper with fingers extended from
his nose.  He does not know whether to pretend he has
not seen it, or how, if he should not overlook it, to deal
with it.  His face works while he tries to decide.  Cupper
should have been warned.  Cupper is not.  Cupper's
fat face grins impudently, and Cupper says: "Please,
sir."
</p>

<p>
"Go and sit down," says Mr. Wriford, trying not
to speak miserably, trying to speak sternly.
</p>

<p>
"But, please, sir!"
</p>

<p>
And thereupon, as hard as he can hit, stinging his
own hand with the force of the blow, putting into it all
he has suffered in this room during the week, Mr. Wriford
hits Master Cupper so that there is a tolerable
interval in which Master Cupper reels somewhere into
the middle of next month before Master Cupper can
so much as howl.
</p>

<p>
Then Master Cupper howls.  Master Cupper, hand
to face, opens his mouth to an enormous cavern and
discharges therefrom four separate emotions in one
immense, shattering, wordless blare of terror and of fury,
of anguish and of surprise.  Scarcely all the boys
shouting together could have surpassed this roar of the
stricken Cupper, and they sit aghast, and Mr. Wriford
stands aghast, while tremendously it comes bellowing
out of the Cupper throat.  Then bawls Cupper: "I'll
tell Mr. Pennyquick!" and out and away he charges,
roaring through playground and into house as he goes
as roars a rocket into the night.  Fainter and more
distant comes the roar, then, true to its rocket character,
and to the consternation of those who listen, culminates
in a muffled explosion of sound and in a moment comes
roaring back again pursued by Mr. Pennyquick who
also roars and drives it before him with blows from a
cane.
</p>

<p>
Woe is Cupper!  Cupper, for appreciation of this
astounding sequel, must be followed as, hand to face,
from assistant-master to Headmaster bellowing he goes.
Blindly the stricken Cupper charges through the study
door, slips on the mat, and blindly charges headlong
into Mr. Pennyquick.
</p>

<p>
Then is the explosion that comes muffled to the
listening schoolroom.  First Cupper, shot head first into
Mr. Pennyquick's waistcoat, knows that his head is
lavishly anointed with strongly smelling medicine which
Mr. Pennyquick is pouring into a tumbler from a very
large medicine bottle labelled "Three Star (old);"
next that his unwounded cheek and ear have suffered
an earthquake compared with which that received by
their fellows from Mr. Wriford was in the nature of a
caress; next that with a bottle and a broken glass he is
rolling on the floor; then, most horrible of all, that
Mr. Pennyquick is springing round the room bellowing:
"WHERE CANE?  WHERE CANE?  WHERE CANE?"
</p>

<p>
There is then a pandemonic struggle between
Mr. Pennyquick, a cupboard, a cataract of heterogeneous
articles which pour out of it upon him, and a bashful
cane which refuses to emerge; and there is finally on
the part of Master Cupper a ghastly realisation of his
personal concern in this terrifying struggle and the
part for which he is cast on its termination.  Invigorated
thereby, up springs Master Cupper, bawling, and
plunges for the door, and simultaneously out comes the
cane, and on comes Mr. Pennyquick, bawling, and
plunges after him.  Master Cupper takes three appalling
cuts of the cane in the embarrassment of getting
through the doorway, two at each turn of the passages,
a shower in the death-trap offered by the open
playground, and comes galloping, a hand to each side of his
face, into the shuddering schoolroom, bawling: "Save
me!  Save me!" and leading by the length of the cane
Mr. Pennyquick, with flaming face and streaming gown,
who cuts at him with bellows of: "FLOG you!  FLOG you!"
</p>

<p>
The circuit of the schoolroom is thrice described with
incredible activity on the part of Cupper, and with
enormous havoc of boys, books, forms, and blackboards
on the part of Mr. Pennyquick.  The air is filled with
dust, impregnated with Three Star (old).  Finally,
and with an exceeding bitter cry, Master Cupper
hurls himself beneath a desk where Mr. Pennyquick
first ineffectually slashes at him, then thrusts at him
as with a bayonet, and then, to the great horror of all,
turns his attention to the room in general.  Up and
down the rows of desks charges Mr. Pennyquick, hacking
at crouching boys with immense dexterity, right and
left, forehand and backhand, as a trooper among
infantry; bellows "WORK UP!  WORK UP!" with each
slash, and with a final cut and thrust at a boy endeavouring
to conceal himself behind a large wall map, and
a final roar of "WORK UP!" disappears in a whirlwind
of streaming gown and flashing cane.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
The schoolroom clock has not altered five minutes
between the first roar of unhappy Cupper, tingling
beneath Mr. Wriford's hand, and the sobbing groans
that now he emits crouching beneath his sheltering
desk.  Yet in that period the whole atmosphere of Tower
House School is drastically and permanently changed.
</p>

<p>
There stands in his place the assistant-master, momentarily
expecting summary dismissal, yet, while to anticipate
it he debates immediate departure, conscious that
the whole room whose butt he has been now cowers
beneath his eye and shudders at his slightest movement.
There tremble on their benches the pupils who in this
appalling manner have seen first the iron discipline of
their assistant-master and next, most surprisingly and
most horribly, his terrific support by Mr. Pennyquick.
In the study there rocks upon his feet the Headmaster
endeavouring to drown in Three Star (old) the memory
of the exhibition he has given, and thinking of
Mr. Wriford, in so far as he is capable of coherent thought,
only in the aspect of one who must be implored to keep
the school together while the outbreak of fury is
explained and lived down by its perpetrator taking to
his bed and his mother reporting a sudden breakdown.
</p>

<p>
Unhappy Cupper, it is to be remarked, martyred in
his poor throbbing flesh for the production of this new
atmosphere, is directly responsible for the several
delusions on which it is in large measure based, in that he
is firmly convinced that he told the Headmaster why
he was come howling to his study and is assured therefore
that it was the reason, not the manner, of his entry
that earned him his subsequent flight for life paid for
so horribly as he ran.  The boys believe he made his
appeal and, in the result of it, are tremblingly resolved
to take any punishment from Mr. Wriford rather than
follow Cupper's example of inviting Mr. Pennyquick's
interference.  Mr. Wriford believes his blow was
reported and awaits dismissal for his loss of temper.  And
finally it is the belief of Mr. Pennyquick that Cupper
made a wilful and groundless entry to his study and
that he was surprised thereby into a violence in which
(said he to Three Star [old]): "God alone knows what
I did."
</p>

<p>
It is while the first onset of these thoughts pursue
their several victims that Master Cupper, under terror
of his own portion in them, creeps snuffling from his
hiding-place to his seat; and to his own seat also, on
tiptoe, very timidly, the young gentleman who had
taken shelter behind the wall map.  Mr. Wriford makes
a sudden movement with the intention of leaving the
Tower House before he is dismissed from it.  A convulsion
passes through the pupils.  They glue their heads
above their books.  Immediately they are in a paroxysm
of study, each separate minute of which surpasses in
intensity the combined labours of any week the Tower
House has known since its Headmaster was forced to
take to medicine.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford remains in his seat to watch this
extraordinary scene.  The hour of the recreation interval
comes and goes.  Not a boy so much as lifts his head.
The close of morning school shows itself upon the clock.
Not a boy moves.  This is the serenest period Mr. Wriford
has known since ever the train from London brought
him here a fortnight ago.  It is a grim eye he sets upon
the devoted heads of his toiling pupils.  He hates them.
For what they have made him endure in these days he
hates them one and all, wholly and severally.  He has a
relish of their desperate industry beneath his observation.
He has a relish that is an actual physical pleasure
in this utter silence, in this feeling that here&mdash;for the
first time since God alone knows when&mdash;he is where
he rules and is not hunted.  He leans back in his chair
in sheer enjoyment of it.  He closes his eyes and delights
that he is utterly still.
</p>

<p>
The luncheon bell rings.  Mr. Wriford goes to the
door and opens it and stands by it.  Very quietly, file
by file from the rows of desks, with bent heads and with
the gentle movements of well trained lambs, the boys
pass out before him.
</p>

<p>
He follows them, and, neither Mr. nor Mrs. Pennyquick
appearing, presides at a meal over which there
broods, as it were, a solemn and religious hush.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
ESSIE'S IDEA OF IT
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
It is Essie who helps Mr. Wriford carry forward the
advantage that Master Cupper has gained him.
Mr. Pennyquick did not show himself throughout the
remainder of the day.  The expected dismissal for having
struck Master Cupper&mdash;awaited in the grim satisfaction
of grovellingly docile pupils throughout afternoon
school and evening preparation&mdash;is deferred, therefore,
as Mr. Wriford supposes, until the morrow; and in the
morning he finds himself mentioning it to Essie.
</p>

<p>
He is the reverse of talkative with the Bickers household.
The oppression that nightly he brings home from
Tower House sits heavily upon him in the bright little
parlour, intensified, as on his first evening there, rather
than relieved by it.  He always dreads the ordeal of
the Bible reading.  He always escapes to bed immediately
it is over.  At breakfast he has excuse to hurry
over his meal and hurry from the house.  On this
morning, however, Essie comes to breakfast dressed in hat
and jacket.  She is going to spend the day with friends
in a neighbouring town.  She has to start for her train
as Mr. Wriford starts for his work and, as his way lies
past the railway station, "Why, we'll jus' skedaddle
together," says Essie.
</p>

<p>
He cannot refuse.  Facing the dismissal he anticipates,
he more than ever desires to be alone; but Essie
takes their companionship on the way for granted, and
presently is chattering by his side of whom she is going
to see, and what a long time it is since she has seen them,
and appearing not at all to notice that he gives her no
response.  She is wonderfully gay and excited, her
cheeks flushed, and her eyes even more radiant than
commonly they sparkle.  She has new gloves, which
she shows him, turning the hand next him this way and
that for their better display and announcing them "not
half a bargain at one-an'-eleven-three, considering I
never had this dress then to match 'em by;" and she
has a linen coat and skirt of lilac shade and a hat of
blue flowers in which she looks quite noticeably pretty;
and she looks at herself in all the shop windows as she
chatters and appears to be more delighted than ever
at what she sees reflected there.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think I shall miss the train, do you?" says
Essie.  "Takes me a long time to say good-bye to
Mother and Dad through not liking leavin' them alone all
day.  Don't think it's very unkind, do you, jus' once in
a way, you know?  You'd never think how I hate doin'
it, though."
</p>

<p>
These are questions, in place of chattering information,
and Mr. Wriford feels he must come out of his
own thoughts to answer them.  He chooses the first
and tells her&mdash;his first words since they left the shop:
"You've plenty of time.  It takes exactly nine minutes
to the station.  I notice it by the big clock every day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's safe as the Bank of England then,"
declares Essie.  "Plenty of time," and she takes advantage
of it to stop deliberately for a moment and twitch
her veil in front of a tobacconist's shining window.
Mr. Wriford pauses for her, and she turns dancing eyes
to him when she has settled her veil to her liking.  "Isn't
it funny, though, seeing yourself with pipes and all in
your face?  Let's have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
He does not join her in the merry laugh she enjoys;
and suddenly he is aware that she is regarding him
curiously, and then that she is making the first personal
remark she has ever addressed to him.  "You aren't
half one of the solemn ones," says Essie.
</p>

<p>
It is then that he tells her: "Well, I'm on my way
to be dismissed.  There's not much joke in that."
</p>

<p>
Essie gives a little exclamation and stops abruptly,
her face all concern.  "Oh, you don't say!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  Come on."
</p>

<p>
"The proper sack?"
</p>

<p>
"Come along.  You'll miss your train."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother the old train!" cries Essie.  "That's
fair done it.  I shan't be half miserable thinking of you."
</p>

<p>
"Why should you?" says Mr. Wriford indifferently.
</p>

<p>
She replies: "Well, did you ever!  Me going off to
enjoy myself and thinking of you getting the sack!  Oh,
that old Whiskyquick, he's a caution!"
</p>

<p>
"But there's no earthly need for you to mind."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course there is," says Essie.  "Especially
with me going off on a beano like this.  Of course there
is.  My goodness, I know what it is for a lodger when
he gets the sack!  Whyever didn't you tell us before&mdash;all
of us?  Then we might have talked it over, and ten
to one Dad could have advised you.  I've seen Dad get
a lodger out of a mess before now.  Just tell me.
Whatever is it for?"
</p>

<p>
"I hit one of the boys."
</p>

<p>
Essie's eyes wince as though herself she felt the
blow.  "Not hard?"
</p>

<p>
"As hard as ever I could."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" says Essie reproachfully.  "You never
ought to do that, you know.  Just a slap&mdash;that's
nothing.  I've fetched one of my Sunday-school boys
a slap before now.  But losing your temper, you know!"
</p>

<p>
"He wanted it," said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"That's what you think," says Essie.  "Well,
never mind about that now.  Just tell me."
</p>

<p>
He tells her.  He finds himself less indifferent to her
sympathy as he proceeds.  He finds it rather a relief
to be telling her of it&mdash;rather pleasantly novel to be
telling anybody anything.  He tells her from the
moment of his blow at Cupper, and why the blow was
struck, to the furious onset of Mr. Pennyquick,
slashing among the boys with his cane&mdash;the humourous
aspect of which he for the first time perceives and
laughs at&mdash;and he finds himself, as he concludes,
rather leaning towards the sympathy he expects.
</p>

<p>
But the sympathy is not for him; nor does Essie,
who usually can see a joke in nothing at all, laugh at
Mr. Pennyquick's wild gallop among his pupils.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, those poor boys!" says Essie.  "Don't I just
feel sorry for them!"
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't if you knew them."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't I, though!  I wish I had half your
chance!"
</p>

<p>
He asks her impatiently, irritated at the unexpected
attitude she has taken: "My chance at what?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, your chance to make them happy.  Why,
they're not boys at all.  I think it every time I see
them."
</p>

<p>
"No, they're little fiends."
</p>

<p>
"That's silly talk," says Essie rather sharply.  "I
daresay you'd be a fiend, for that matter, with that
old toad of a Whiskyquick not to care what happens to
you except to frighten you to death."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford says coldly: "I didn't know we were
talking about the boys.  You asked me to tell you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cries Essie, "don't you get a crosspatch now!
I know it was about your sack we were talking, and I am
sorry, truly and reely sorry.  But, look here, I don't
believe you'll get it, you know.  I believe old
Whiskyquick's that ashamed of himself he won't show his face
for a week.  An' I don't believe he even knows you hit
that poor what's-his-name&mdash;Cupper?&mdash;so there!  I
believe he hit him for disturbing him, and I daresay
catching him drinking, before the poor little fellow
could speak.  I do reely.  Look here&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
They have reached the station and Essie stops outside
the booking-office.  "Look here, I tell you what
there is to it.  Don't you worry about the sack.  Ten
to one you won't get it till he's got some one instead of
you, anyway.  Just you don't worry.  It only makes it
worse, like when you're going to have a tooth out.
You see if you can't make those poor boys happy.
Why, you know, when I first had my Sunday-school
class, oh, they were cautions!  They'd never had any
one to be kind to them, jus' like your boys.  I told 'em
stories, and told 'em games, and took 'em a walk every
time, and showed 'em things, and you'd never believe
how good they are now.  You just try.  I mean to say,
whatever's the good of anybody if you don't try to
make other folk happy, is there?  Oh, there's my train
signalled.  Goo'-by.  I shan't half think how you're
getting on.  I say, though&mdash;" and Essie, who has been
extraordinarily grave in this long speech, begins to
sparkle in her eyes again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't got a minute to buy my ticket?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll get your ticket, of course."
</p>

<p>
"That's fine."  She counts him some money from
her purse.  "Third return Wilton, excursion.  Mind
you say excursion.  One and tuppence.  Here comes
the puffer."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford says "excursion;" and then Essie, by
hanging back as the train comes in, indicates clearly
enough that she would like him also to find her a
carriage.  When she is in and leaning from the window
she explains the reason of these manoeuvres.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks awfully," says Essie and whispers: "You
know, I like people to see me with a young man to fuss
me about."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's smile is the first expression of real
amusement he has known in many long months.  As
the train begins to move he raises his hat.  "Oh, thanks
awfully," cries Essie, immensely pleased.  "Remember
what I said.  I shan't half think how you're getting on.
Mind you remember!  Goo'-bye!  Goo'-bye!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
He remembers.  Mr. Pennyquick's manner at roll-call
and prayers distinctly bears out all three of Essie's
conjectures, and that helps him to remember.  The
Headmaster charges through the names and through the
devotions even more rapidly than usual.  At their
termination he does not even indulge the pretence of
taking Form One in a lesson.  "Amen&mdash;WORK UP!"
concludes Mr. Pennyquick and turns at once to
Mr. Wriford.  "Can you possibly take them all this
morning, Wriford?  Just for once.  I absolutely ought to be
in bed.  I'm on the very verge of a breakdown.  You
saw what happened to me yesterday.  I really don't
know what I'm doing.  The doctor insists on a little
wine, but I'm fighting against it.  Perhaps I'm wrong.
But you know my principles.  If you could just look
after them till lunch."  He strides to the door, opens it,
closes it again, strides back and glares upon his pupils,
strained over their books.  "WORK UP!" and then
more threateningly, more hoarsely than ever: "WORK
UP!  WORK UP!" and then to the door and a last
"WORK UP!" and then discharges himself from view
as abruptly as if Three Star (old) had stretched a hand
across the playground and grabbed him out.
</p>

<p>
Thus are proved, as Mr. Wriford reflects, seated in
the shivering silence that remains after the Headmaster's
disappearance, two of Essie's beliefs.  Mr. Pennyquick
is obviously ashamed of himself&mdash;apprehensive of the
results upon his boys and upon his assistant-master of
his yesterday's exhibition and seeking by greater fierceness
to coerce the one and by pitiable excuses to cajole
the other; obviously also he projects no summary
measures against Mr. Wriford&mdash;likely enough, indeed, is
ignorant of cause of offence.  There remains Essie's
third premise: that the boys are wretched and to be
pitied; and with it her advice that it is for Mr. Wriford
to make them happy.  He remembers.  He looks on
them, cowed before him, with the new eyes of these
instructions, and for the first time since he has assumed
his position here sees them, not as little fiends who have
made his life a burden, but as luckless unfortunates
whose lives have themselves been burdensome under
one tyrant, and who now believe themselves delivered
over to another.
</p>

<p>
He remembers.  He remembers Essie's Sunday-school
boys who were "little cautions" until she told
'em stories and showed 'em games and took 'em
for walks and showed 'em things; and suddenly
Mr. Wriford sits upright and says briskly: "Look
here!"
</p>

<p>
There is a sharp catching at breaths all about the
room, a nervous jump&mdash;a panic apprehension, clearly
enough, that this is the prelude to repetition of yesterday's
violence.  It makes Mr. Wriford feel very sorry.
He remembers Essie's "Poor little fellows.  I don't
feel half sorry for them."  He contrasts their dejected
and aimless and slipshod and now frightened ways
with his own bright school-days.  He gets up and steps
down from the platform on which his desk is raised and
stands amongst them, his hands in his pockets, feeling
curiously confident and easy.  "Look here," says
Mr. Wriford, "let's chuck work this morning and have a
talk.  We ought to be jolly good pals, you know,
instead of messing about like we've been doing ever since
I came.  When I was at school we used to be frightful
pals with our masters.  Of course we couldn't stick
'em in Form sometimes, but out of school they were
just like one of us.  They played footer and all that
with us, and the great thing was to barge them like
blazes, especially if one had had a sock over the ear
like poor old Cupper there."
</p>

<p>
First surprise; then a nervous giggle here and there;
then more general giggling; now all turning towards
Master Cupper (very red and sheepish), and very
cheerful giggling everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Rather jolly, thinks Mr. Wriford, and proceeds:
"How is old Cupper, this morning, by the way?
Cupper, you and I ought to shake hands, you know," and
Mr. Wriford strolls down to Master Cupper, and they
shake, Master Cupper grinning enormously.  "That's
all right.  You and I are pals, anyway.  You and I
versus the rest in future, Cupper, if they get up to any
of their larks.  You were a silly young ass, you know,
yesterday, cocking a snook at me behind my back.
That's absolutely what you'd expect a Board School
kid to do.  What's your father, Cupper?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, he's an auctioneer," says Cupper.
</p>

<p>
"Auctioneer, is he?  Well, you look out he doesn't
sell you one of these days, my boy, if you go cocking
snooks all over the place."
</p>

<p>
Immensely delighted laughter at this brilliant flash
of wit, and Mr. Wriford sits easily on Cupper's desk
with his feet on the form before him and goes on.  "You
know, you're all rather young asses, you are, really.
You don't work in school, and you don't play out of it.
Why, hang it, you don't even play cricket.  You're
keen on cricket, aren't you?"
</p>

<p>
Enthusiastic exclamations of "Rather!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you go fiddling about with rounders&mdash;a
girl's game; and you don't even play that as
if you meant it.  Why on earth don't you play
cricket?"
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir," says some one, "we haven't got any
proper bats and wickets."
</p>

<p>
"Man alive," says Mr. Wriford, "you've got some
stumps and a ball, and I've seen an old bat kicking
about.  What more do you want?  Tell you what,
we'll start right away and get up Cricket Sixes&mdash;single
wicket, six a side.  They're a frightful rag.  We can
get three&mdash;four teams of six boys each.  Each team
plays all the rest twice to see which is the champion.
We'll keep all the scores in an exercise book and call
it the Tower House Cricket League.  I'll be scorer
and umpire.  Come on, we'll pick the Sixes right
away."
</p>

<p>
Up to his desk Mr. Wriford goes amidst a buzzing
of delight and gets a clean exercise book and then
says: "Half a moment, though.  We ought to have a
Captain of the School, you know, and some
Prefects&mdash;Monitors.  The Captain will be my right-hand man,
and the Prefects will be his.  We'll vote for him.  That's
the best way.  Each of you chaps write down the man
you think ought to be the Captain, and then old Cupper
will collect the papers and bring them to me, and we'll
count them together."
</p>

<p>
It is done amid much excitement, and presently
Mr. Wriford hails Abbot as Captain of the School, and up
comes Abbot, loudly applauded, a red-headed young
gentleman of pleasant countenance, to shake hands
with Mr. Wriford and with him to select the Prefects.
Three Prefects, Mr. Wriford thinks, and says: "I vote
we have old Cupper for one."
</p>

<p>
"And Toovey," says Abbot.
</p>

<p>
"Right, Toovey.  And what about Samuel Major?
He looks a bit of a beefer.  Well now," continues
Mr. Wriford, thoroughly interested, "you four chaps had
better each be captain of one of the Cricket Sixes.
We'll pick them next.  They must all be as equal as
possible."
</p>

<p>
This takes quite a long time, but is satisfactorily
settled at last and the names written down in the
exercise-book and the first two matches arranged for
that afternoon: Abbot's <i>versus</i> Toovey's, and Samuel
Major's <i>v.</i> Cupper's.  Then "Good Lord," says
Mr. Wriford, looking at the clock, "it's nearly lunch time.
I vote we chuck it now and go and look out these stumps
and things and find a decent pitch.  Half a minute,
though.  You, Abbot, you know, and you three Prefect
chaps must remember what you are and must help me
to keep order and to see that no one plays the fool in
school or out, and all that kind of thing; and you other
chaps must jolly well obey them.  This afternoon, for
instance, we'll have a talk about work and see just
where we all stand and make up our minds to work like
blazes.  Well, while I'm fixing up Form Three, you
must see that Form One doesn't play the goat, Abbot,
and you, Samuel, must look after Form Two.  See the
idea of the thing?  Work is jolly interesting, you know,
if you go at it properly, like I'll show you.  Some
subjects&mdash;like geography for instance&mdash;we'll take all
together, and that'll be quite a rag.  We're simply going
to pull up our socks and work like blazes and play like
blazes, too.  See?  Come on, let's get those cricket
things fixed up."
</p>

<p>
Out they go.  Mr. Wriford holding Abbot's arm, and
other boys clinging about him&mdash;out to the field where
first from the roadside he had seen them dejected and
listless, and where now they run before him, keen,
excited, eager, taken right out of their old sorry
habits.
</p>

<p>
He, also, the first time in many months, out of himself
removed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
Mr. Wriford goes back to the plumber's shop that
night occupied with plans for developing on the morrow
the interests of the Cricket Sixes, the Captaincy, the
Prefects, and the new schedule of lessons drawn up
during the afternoon.  Essie is home before him,
chattering more volubly and more brightly than ever by
reason of her doings with her friends and her day-long
desertion of Mother and Dad.  She runs to the shop
door when she hears Mr. Wriford and greets him eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"You never got the sack, did you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he never said a word.  I believe you were right
about him being rather ashamed."
</p>

<p>
Essie does a little dance of joy and claps her hands.
"Oh, if I'm not lucky, though!" cries Essie.  "That
was the one thing would have spoilt the fair jolly old
time I've had, and there it's turned out A1 just like
all the rest!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford tells her: "It's very nice of you to be
glad about it."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course I'm glad," cries Essie.  "That's
just finished up my day a treat!  Now you won't half
enjoy the things I've brought home for supper from
my young lady friends.  I was afraid&mdash;oh, you don't
know what it is to have a lodger about the house when
he's lost his job!  They're fair cautions, lodgers are,
when they've got the sack!"
</p>

<p>
And later in the evening, when he sees Essie sitting
and looking before her with her eyes smiling and her
lips twitching, she suddenly looks up, and catching
his gaze, reveals that it is of him she is thinking.  "You
weren't half in the dumps, though, were you?" she
says.  "Isn't it funny, though, when a thing's turned
out A1, to look back and see what a state you were in?
Isn't it, though?  Let's have a laugh!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0506"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
THE VACANT CORNER
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
The morrow finds eager pupils awaiting Mr. Wriford,
and eager work and eager play, and again in the evening
he is returning to the plumber's shop occupied with the
plans for the next day thrown up by these new developments.
</p>

<p>
So it is also on the following day, and so the next,
and so by day and day and week and week.  Interestedly
and swiftly the time in these preoccupations
passes.  He is quite surprised to find one evening that
weeks to the number of half the term have gone.
Captain of the School Abbot brings it to his notice; and
on arrival at Tower House next morning Mr. Wriford
brings it, together with Abbot's reason for mentioning
it, to the notice of Mr. Pennyquick.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford knocks on the study door, waits for the
"One moment!  One moment!" which is called to
him and which gives a chinking of glass in suggestion
of the fact that the Headmaster is putting away the
medicine bottles, exhibition of which, as an Open-air
Man, is so distasteful to him, and then enters to find
the Open-air Man lying, as usual, on the sofa, amidst
an air that appears to have escaped from beneath a
cork rather than have come from the window.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford expresses the hope that he is better,
Mr. Pennyquick the fear that he is not, and there is then
brought forward the suggestion advanced by Abbot.
</p>

<p>
"Thursday is half-term," says Mr. Wriford.  "Do
you think the boys might have a holiday?  They've
been working very well."
</p>

<p>
"A whole holiday?" says Mr. Pennyquick doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford knows perfectly well the reason for the
dubiety in the Headmaster's voice.  In these days he
has taken the work of the school entirely out of
Mr. Pennyquick's hands.  Mr. Pennyquick no longer so
much as reads roll-call and prayers.  Abbot calls the
roll and is mighty proud of the duty; Mr. Wriford
takes prayers.  Mr. Pennyquick perhaps twice in a
week will tear himself from his sofa and his medicines
and suddenly burst upon the schoolroom, patrol a few
turns with loud and quite unnecessary "WORK UP'S!"
and as suddenly discharge himself again to his study.
</p>

<p>
The less frequently he appears, the more he shirks
any scholastic duties with the neglect they entail of
nursing his distressing ailments in the seclusion of his
study.  Thus it is the idea of having the boys on his
hands for a complete day that gives this doubt to his
tone when a whole holiday is projected, and Mr. Wriford,
well aware of it, quickly reassures him on the point.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think they deserve a whole holiday," says
Mr. Wriford.  "Of course I'd come up just the same
and look after&mdash;"

<p>
"My dear fellow, a whole holiday by all means,"
Mr. Pennyquick breaks in.  "By all means.  Splendid!
They deserve it.  You're doing wonderfully with them,
my dear fellow.  My mother reports she has never
known them so happy or so well-behaved.  No ragging
in the dormitories at night.  Cold baths every morning
at their own request.  Good God, do you know I'm so
much a cold bath man myself that I take one twice a
day&mdash;twice a day winter and summer&mdash;when I'm
fit.  Clean and smart and quiet at meals.  Perfect
silence in the schoolroom.  Keen, manly play in the
field.  Devoted to you.  My dear fellow, you're
wonderful.  Whole holiday?  Whole holiday by all means.
I was going to suggest it myself."
</p>

<p>
"Thursday, then," says Mr. Wriford.  "They'll be
delighted.  I thought of playing cricket in the morning
and then, if you agree, asking Mrs. Pennyquick if
she could fix us up some lunch and tea things in hampers,
and we'd go and picnic all the rest of the day at
Penrington woods and bathe in the river and that kind of
thing."
</p>

<p>
The Headmaster thinks it splendid.  "Splendid, my
dear fellow.  Splendid.  Certainly.  I'll see to it myself.
Cricket!  Bathing!  Good God, you'll think it very
weak of me, but I feel devilish near crying when I think
of a jolly day like that and me tied up here and unable
to share it.  Cricket!  Good God, why, when I was at
Oxford I made nine consecutive centuries for my college
one year.  It's a fact.  Nine absolutely&mdash;or was it
ten?  I must look it up.  I believe it was ten.  Bathing!
My dear fellow, a few years ago I thought nothing of a
couple of miles swim before breakfast&mdash;side-stroke,
breast-stroke, back-stroke; good God, I was an eel in
the water, a living eel.  I'm an outdoor man,
absolutely.  Always have been.  That's the cruelty of it.
Hullo, there's the bell.  I shall take prayers this
morning, Wriford.  I'm coming in all day for a real good
day's work with the dear fellows.  I don't know what the
doctor will say, but I'm going to do it."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford is at the door, and the Outdoor Man
already stretching down an arm to feel beneath the
sofa.  "Perhaps not prayers," says the Outdoor Man.
"You'd better not wait for me for prayers.  I've just
my loathsome medicine to take.  Take prayers for me
for once, like a good fellow, and I'll be with you in two
minutes.  Splendid.  You're wonderful.  Two minutes.
Damn."
</p>

<p>
There is the sound of a bottle upset beneath the
sofa, and Mr. Wriford hurries off to find Abbot already
halfway through the roll, then to take prayers, and
then, amidst tremendous applause, to announce a whole
holiday for Thursday's half-term.
</p>

<p>
"Well, come on, let's make certain we deserve it,"
says Mr. Wriford, when the manifestations of joy have
been sufficiently expressed.  "Come along, Form Two,
arithmetic.  Let's see if we can't understand these
frightful decimals.  Clean the blackboard, Toovey.
Abbot, you take Form Three behind the curtain and
give them their dictation.  Here's the book.  Find an
interesting bit and read it out loud first.  Form One,
you're algebra.  You'd better take the next six
examples.  Cupper, you're in charge.  Now then, Two,
crowd around.  Where's the chalk?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
This was the spirit of the lessons nowadays.
Everybody worked.  Nobody shirked.  Interest, even
excitement, was found under Mr. Wriford's guidance to lie
in the hated lesson-books, and it was excitedly wrestled
out of them.  Some of the subjects, as Mr. Wriford
taught them, were made exciting in themselves; the
rest were somehow inspired with the feeling that the
next chapter&mdash;the next chapter really is exciting once
we can get to it.  All the Tower House schoolbooks were
horribly thumbed and inked and dog-eared in their
first few pages&mdash;long indifferently laboured over,
never understood, cordially loathed.  Beyond lay virgin
pages, clean, untouched, many sticking together as
when fresh from the binder's press.  "Look here,"
Mr. Wriford used to say, "these French grammars,
they're all the same&mdash;all in a filthy state up to page
thirty and rippingly clean beyond, just like a new
story-book.  Look here, let's pretend all that new part is a
country we're going to emigrate into and explore, and
that first of all we've got to toil over the Rocky
Mountains of all this first muck.  You half know it, you know.
If we get through a good few pages every time we'll
get there like lightning.  Come on!"
</p>

<p>
They always "came on" responsive to this kind of
call.  The work in all the subjects belonged to the
distant period of Mr. Wriford's own school-days.  He had
to get it up as it came.  He brought to the boys the
quite novel effect of a master learning with them as
they learnt, and that produced the stimulus of following
him in place of the grind of being driven.  "My word,
this is a teaser!" Mr. Wriford would say, frankly
stumped by an arithmetical problem; and the delighted
laugh that always greeted this was the impetus to an
eager and intelligent following him when he would get
it aright and demonstrate its processes.  Wits were
sharpened, perceptions stirred.  Boyish high spirits,
mental alertness, and vigorous young qualities were
rescued from the dejection and apathy and slovenliness
and ugliness that had threatened to submerge them:
and Mr. Wriford finds himself infected and carried
along by the moral quickening he has himself aroused.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
He knows it.  He feels it.  He both knows and feels
it because, whereas formerly he groped ever in darkness
of spirit and beneath intolerable oppression of mind,
now, when engaged in these occupations or when thinking
upon them, he is lifted out of himself, and in the
zest of their activities forgets the burden of his own
tribulations.  Thus what had been all darkness, all
shrinking, all fears, becomes divided, as street lamps
break the night, into periods of light while he is within
the arc of these pursuits and into passages of the old
gloom only between one day's leaving of the school
and the next morning's return to it.  Slowly from this
he advances to stronger influence of the light, less
frequent onset of the shadows.  First by these lamps the
measureless blackness of his way is broken.  Gradually
he is handed more quickly and more surely from lamp
to lamp.  Not often now, with their immense and
crushing weight, their suffocating sense of numbing
fear, those old and intolerable clouds of misery descend
upon him; not often now those black abysses that
yawned on every side about his feet; not often those
entombing walls that towered every way about his
soul.  Sometimes they come.  He, in the days of that
nightmare hunted life in London, sometimes had known
snatched intervals of relief&mdash;in companionship, in
reading&mdash;in the midst of which there would strike
down upon him the thought that this was but transitory,
that presently it would end, that presently he
would be returned to the strain, to the fears, to the
darkness, to the panic bursting to get out of it.  So now,
sometimes, when his mind moved ever so little from its
occupation with these new interests, he would be clutched
as though immediately outside them clutching hands
waited to drag him out and drag him down&mdash;clutched
and engulfed and bound again in bonds of terror, as
one whose pleasant slumber suddenly gives place to
dreadful sense of falling.  In the midst of his thoughts
upon some aspect of work or play with his pupils, "This
cannot go on always," he would think; "This will
somehow come to an end sooner or later;" and
immediately the waiting hands would up and snatch him
down; immediately the fears oppress him; immediately
the walls, the blackness come; and he would cry:
"What then?  Where then?" and grope again; and
bruise once more himself on his despair; and plan to go
away and abandon it all, so that at least he might of
his own will leave these interests, not wait till suddenly
they to their own end should come and he be driven
from them.
</p>

<p>
So sometimes these old tumults came upon him; yet
came less frequently, and the less frequently they came
were with less suffering escaped.  Now, in their onsets,
was for the first time a way of refuge from them.  Where
formerly he had been utterly abandoned to them,
sinking more and more deeply within them at every cry of
his despair, now was a knowledge that they could be
lost; and quicker and more strongly a conscious grasp
at what should lose them and draw him out from their
oppression.  At first with dreadful effort and often
with defeat, gradually with less affliction and with more
certain hold, he would attempt to turn his mind from
these broodings and fasten it upon his enterprises in
the school.  There was to be thought out a way of
helping Form Two to get the hang of parsing in their
English grammar to-morrow; there was the idea of
starting the young beggars in a daily class of drill and
physical exercises; there was the plan of rummaging
among Pennyquick's books to pick out a little library
of light reading for the boys and to read to them
himself for half an hour each day; there was the thought
of how jolly nicely they had responded to his proposal
to go through their play-boxes and pick out all the
cheap trash he found they had been reading, and of the
jokes they had had over the bonfire made from the
collection; there was the thinking of other ways in
which this complete confidence they gave him could be
used for their own benefit; there was&mdash;there were a
hundred of such preoccupations for his mind, any one
of which, could he but fix tenaciously enough upon it,
would draw him from the quicksands of his depression
and set his feet where strongly they bore him.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>
Thus came he gradually into a state in which the old
depths of oppression troubled him no more; in which
the apprehensive, hunted look went from his eyes; in
which sometimes a smile was to be seen upon his face;
and in which&mdash;to the observer&mdash;his outstanding
attribute was just that he was very quiet, very
reserved: gently responsive to advances from others but
never of himself offering conversation.  So may one
newly convalescent after great illness be observed; and
to this Mr. Wriford's case in these days may best be
likened.  As the convalescent, after long pains, deliriums,
fevers, nights void of sleep, is carried to sit in the
sunshine from the bed where these have been endured, so
in this haven rested Mr. Wriford from his mind's
distresses.  There sits the patient, wan and weak, desirous
only to enjoy the pleasant air, wanting no more than
just to feed upon the smiling prospect his eyes that all
the devils of his fevered brain have burned; silently
acquiescent to ministrations of those who tend him.
Here lived Mr. Wriford, quiet and reserved, no longer
preyed upon by those fierce storms of hopeless misery
such as, on the first night at the Bickers' table, had
sent him torn and broken from the room; wearing a
gentle aspect now in place of those contracted eyes,
that knotted brow, born of the fever in his brain; hands
no longer trembling; voice eased of its strained and
rasping note that came of fear it should break out of his
control and go in tears of his distress.  There rests the
convalescent's body, thin and enfeebled from its
rackings on the bed.  Here stayed Mr. Wriford, wanting
only here to stay where refuge was from all the devils
that had devoured him.  There rests the patient, slowly
replanning life that death had challenged, sickness
shattered.  Here lived he, quietly revolving what had
brought him here and what should follow now.
</p>

<p>
Was there something in life that he had missed?
Calmly now he could ask and search the question.  Till
now, since its first coming, it had been as a gnawing
tumour, as an empoisoned wound within him&mdash;an
inward fire, a pulsing abscess to relieve whose tortures
he, as a wild beast thus maddened that turns its jaws
upon its vitals, had bruised himself to madness in
frantic goadings of his mind.  Now he could review it
calmly, almost dispassionately.  The thing was out of
him, no longer burning in his brain.  Till now, he had
thought upon it in frenzy of despair, now he could
stand as it were away from it&mdash;turn it this way and
that in examination with his hands, smile and shake
his head in puzzlement, and put it aside to go to his
duties with his boys, return and take it up and puzzle
it again.  Was there something in life that he had
missed?  Yes, there was something.  He could unriddle
it as far as that.  He was at peace now, but there was
nothing in that peace.  Some attribute was missing.
This was peace: but it was emptiness.  This was
quietness: but a thousand leagues remote from happiness.
Happiness was an active thing, a stirring thing, a living
thing, a warm thing, a pulsing thing.  Barren here,
cold here.  Let the mind run, let the mind run about a
thousand pleasures such as money could buy.  They
might be his for the asking.  He had but to return to
London, and they were his.  Well, let the mind run.
Back it would come disconsolate, empty-handed, with
no treasures in its pack.  Nothing attracted him.  Ah,
but somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, that thing
was&mdash;the live thing, the stirring thing, the active
thing, the warm thing.  Something that he had missed
in life: that was certain.  Happiness its name: that
was assured.  Where?  In what?  How to be found?
Only negative answers to these.  Well, shake the head
over it and put it away; smile and confess its bafflement.
Here are things to be done.  Do them and return to
puzzle again in a little while.
</p>

<p>
So and in this wise quietly through the days&mdash;standing
aside in this retreat and looking at life as one that,
furnishing a room, stands to stare at a bare corner, and
only knows something is wanted there, and only knows
that nothing of all he has will suit, and only turns away
but to return again and stare.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
ESSIE
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
That simile of Mr. Wriford's condition in these days
to one who, rearranging the furniture of his room,
stares in constant bafflement at a bare corner and can
by no means determine with what to fill it, may be
advanced a further step.  The decorator's eye,
narrowly judging all the objects that are at his disposal,
will in time, in a "better than nothing" spirit, turn
more frequently to one, and presently he will try it:
there came a time when it occurred to Mr. Wriford,
dispassionately revolving the vacancy in his life, that
there was one might fill it&mdash;Essie.
</p>

<p>
One day, and this was the beginning of the idea&mdash;not
then conceived&mdash;Mr. Wriford asked Essie if he
might take her for a walk.  A Saturday evening was the
day: a July evening, cool and still&mdash;very grateful and
inviting after oppressive heat through morning and
afternoon; a breeze come up with nightfall.  There
was no preparation class at Tower House on Saturdays.
Mr. Wriford left his boys reading the books he had
rummaged for them out of Mr. Pennyquick's library
and came home to early supper.  By eight o'clock Essie
had washed up, and Mr. Wriford came to her where
she was standing by the shop door enjoying the pleasant
air.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it jolly, though?" said Essie, moving to give
him place beside her in the entrance.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's beautifully cool now," Mr. Wriford agreed.
</p>

<p>
Several young couples&mdash;man and maid&mdash;were
passing in one direction up the street.  Mr. Wriford
watched Essie's face as she watched them.  He could
see her eyes shining and those little twitches of her lips
as she observed each separate swain and maid.  With
the slow passing of one pair, their hands clasped, walking
very close together, she gave a little squirm and a little
sound of merriment and turned to him.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't they funny, though," said Essie, "courting!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford asked her: "Where are they all going?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, they're going to the Gardens, of course.
There isn't half a jolly band plays there Saturday
evenings."
</p>

<p>
She was the prettiest little thing, as Mr. Wriford
looked at her, standing there beside him.  He liked her
merry ways, so different from his own habitual quietude.
It occurred to him that, apart from that walk to the
station together some weeks before, he hardly ever had
spoken to her out of her parents' company.  Why
not?&mdash;so pretty and jolly as she was.
</p>

<p>
A sudden impulse came to him.  He hesitated to
speak it.  She might resent the suggestion.  He looked
at her again&mdash;those funny little twitchings of her lips!
"May I take you for a stroll, Essie?" he said.
</p>

<p>
There was not the least reason to have hesitated.
Essie's face showed her pleasure.  She quite jumped
from her leaning pose against the doorway.  "Oh,
that's fine!" cried Essie.  "I'll just pop on my chapeau.
I won't be half a tick."
</p>

<p>
She was gone with the words, and he heard her
running briskly up the stairs to her room and then
very briskly down again and then in the parlour,
crying: "Dad, me an' the lodger are going for a stroll in
the Gardens.  Sure you've got everything you want,
Mother?  Look, there's the new silk when you've
finished that ball.  Isn't it pretty, though!" and then
the sound of a kiss for Mother and a kiss for Dad;
and then coming to him, gaily swinging her gloves in a
brown little hand, her eyes quite extraordinarily sparkling.
</p>

<p>
"There you are!" cried Essie, and they started.
"That wasn't long, was it?  Why, some girls, you
know, keep their young fellows waiting a treat."
</p>

<p>
"Do they?" said Mr. Wriford, a trifle coldly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't they just!" cried Essie, noticing nothing
that his tone might have been intended to convey, and
beginning, as they went on in silence, to walk every
now and then with a gay little skip as though by that
means to exercise her delighted spirits.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, now that he was embarked upon his
sudden impulse, found himself somehow dissatisfied
with it.  He would have been embarrassed, perhaps a
little disappointed, he told himself, had she refused
his invitation.  He found himself embarrassed, perhaps
a little piqued, that she had accepted it so readily, taken
it so much as a matter of course.  And then there was
that "young fellow" expression with its obvious
implication.  His idea had been that she would have
shown herself conscious of being&mdash;well, flattered, by
his invitation.  Not, he assured himself, that there was
anything flattering in it; but still&mdash;.  Perhaps, though,
she was more conscious of it than she had seemed to
show; and coming to that thought he asked her suddenly,
giving her the opportunity to say so: "I hope
you didn't mind my proposing to take you for a
walk?"
</p>

<p>
Essie skipped.  "Good gracious!" cried Essie.
"Whyever?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought you might think it rather&mdash;sudden."
</p>

<p>
Essie laughed and skipped again.  "Sudden!  Why,
you've bin long enough, goodness knows!  Why, I've
bin expecting you to ask me for weeks, you know!"
</p>

<p>
"Have you?" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Think I have!" cried Essie.  "Why, the lodger
always does!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
This time Essie seemed to detect something amiss in
his tone.  In a few paces she was bending forward as she
walked and trying to read his face.  "I say," said
Essie, "you aren't in a crosspatch, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'm not.  Why should I be?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure I don't know.  You wanted me to come, didn't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I did.  I shouldn't have asked you otherwise."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't know," said Essie.  "Young fellows
are that funny sometimes!"
</p>

<p>
Silence between them after that, but as they came
to the Gardens Essie showed that the funny ways of
young fellows had been occupying her in the interval.
"Of course, you're always very quiet, aren't you?" she
said.
</p>

<p>
"I don't talk much," Mr. Wriford agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you don't!" cried Essie and seemed so
reassured by the recollection that Mr. Wriford suddenly
felt he had been behaving a little unkindly&mdash;stupidly;
and with some idea of making amends smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
Essie flashed back with eyes and lips.  "Of course
you don't!" she cried again.  "Well, I vote we enjoy
ourselves now if ever.  Just look at all the lights!  See
the funny little blue ones?  Aren't they funny though,
all twinkling!  Let's have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
With a laugh, therefore, into the Gardens; and with
a laugh Mr. Wriford's unreasoning distemper put off.
Jolly little Essie!
</p>

<p>
No need, moreover, to do more than listen to her,
and to think how jolly she was, and how pretty she
looked, as she turned chattering to him while she led the
way among the groups clustered about the bandstand.
"We'll go right through," said Essie.  "There's seats
up there where you can sit an' hear the band an' see
the lights a treat.  Jus' watch a minute to see that great
big fat man with the trombone where he keeps coming
in pom! pom!  There!  See him?  Oh, isn't he a
caution!"
</p>

<p>
Close to Mr. Wriford she stands, and Mr. Wriford
watches her watch the fat gentleman with the trombone,
her lips twitching while she waits for his turn and then
her little squirm of glee when he raises his instrument
to his mouth and solemnly administers his deliberate
pom! pom! to the melody.  "Oh, dear!" cries Essie,
"isn't this just too jolly for anything!  Come along.
Up this path.  I know a not half quiet little seat up
here.  I say, though!  When you've been looking at
the lights!  If this isn't dark!  Oo-oo!"
</p>

<p>
This "Oo-oo!" is expressive of the fact that really
it is rather ticklish work suddenly being launched on a
pitch dark path, falling away steeply at the sides, after
the glare of the bandstand; and with the "Oo-oo!"
comes Essie's arm pressing very close against
Mr. Wriford's and her hand against his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Let's hold hands," says Essie, and her fingers come
wriggling into his&mdash;-cool and firm, her fingers, and
there is the faint chink of the bracelets that she wears.
"I like holding hands, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
Cool and firm her fingers.  His hand is unresponsive,
but rather jolly to feel them come wriggling into it and
then twine about it.  She settles them to her liking, and
this is enlocked about his own, her palm to his.  Yes,
rather jolly to feel them thus: they give him a curious
thrill, a desire.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Essie's seat was found to be quite the not half quiet
little place that she had promised.  It stood at the
termination of the winding path, backed by a high
rockery of ferns and looking down upon the lights and
the bandstand whence came the music very pleasantly
through the distance.
</p>

<p>
Here were influences that touched anew the curious
thrill her fingers had given Mr. Wriford.  The warm,
still night, the feeling of remoteness here, the music
floating up, Essie very close beside him, her face clear
to his eyes in this soft glow of summer darkness.  A
very long time since to Mr. Wriford there had been such
playfulness of spirit as stirred within him now.  Soft
she was where she touched him, sensibly warm against
his arm, enticingly fragrant.
</p>

<p>
"Told you this would be jolly, didn't I?" said
Essie.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is," agreed Mr. Wriford, and put his arm
along the seat behind her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Essie didn't seem to mind.
</p>

<p>
And then his hand upon the shoulder further from
him.
</p>

<p>
Nor to mind that.
</p>

<p>
"All right, I call it," said Essie.  "You know, if
you came out more to the band and places like this,
you soon wouldn't be so quiet."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't care much about it by myself," said
Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'd come with you," Essie assured him.
"Nothing's much fun not when you do it by yourself.
I say, whatever are you doing with that arm of yours
on my shoulder?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not doing anything with it," said Mr. Wriford,
and gave a little laugh, and said: "I'm going to,
though."
</p>

<p>
"What?"
</p>

<p>
"This."
</p>

<p>
"Oo-oo!" cried Essie.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford's "This" was bending his face to
hers, and his arm slipped a little lower down her
shoulders, and drawing her towards him.  "Oo-oo-oo!" cried
Essie and pressed away and turned away her head.
"Oo-oo!" and then he kissed her cheek, then brought
his other arm around and turned her face to his.
"Oo-oo-oo!  I say, you know!"&mdash;and there, close beneath
his own, were those soft, expressive lips of hers, and
twice he kissed them: and of a sudden she was relaxed
in his arms, no longer struggling, and there were depths
in those eyes of hers, and this time a long kiss.
</p>

<p>
"There!" said Mr. Wriford and released her; and
immediately two curious emotions followed in his mind.
First, that, now the thing was over, it was over&mdash;completed,
done, not attracting any more.
</p>

<p>
"I say, you know!" said Essie, settling her hat and
pouting at him: and all rosy she was, all radiant,
enticingly pouting, pretending aggrievement&mdash;just the
very blushes, pouts, and smiles to have it done again.
But for Mr. Wriford not enticing at all: over, done;
conceiving in him almost a distaste of it; and, moved
a trifle away from her, he said hardly: "I suppose the
lodger always does that, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, most of 'em," said Essie cheerfully; and at
that his new emotion quickened, and he made a
petulant, angry movement with his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
She detected his meaning just as she had detected
the coldness in his voice as they came down towards the
Gardens together a short while before.  She detected
his meaning, and answered him sharply, and the words
of her defence and the manner of it broke out in
him the second of the two emotions that followed his
caprice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's the odds to it if they have?" said
Essie, sitting up very straight and speaking very tensely.
"Where's the harm?  It's only fun.  Not as if I had a
proper young fellow of my own.  Take jolly good care
if I had!  Where's the harm?  I like being kissed.  I like
to think some one's fond of me."
</p>

<p>
Now, for all the sharpness of her tone, she looked
appealing: a trifle of a flutter in those expressive lips
of hers: a hint of a catch in her voice.  Swiftly to
Mr. Wriford came his second emotion.  Poor little Essie
that liked to think some one was fond of her!  Jolly
little Essie with her "Let's have a laugh!"  Here was
the kindest, cheeriest little creature in the world!  Let
him enjoy it!
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, Essie," said Mr. Wriford and moved
to her again and took her brown little hand.
</p>

<p>
"Glad you think so, I'm sure!" said Essie.  "That's
my hand, if you've no objection," and she withdrew it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford took it again and held it while it wriggled.
"Come, who's the crosspatch now?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's nice!" cried Essie.  "I'm sure I'm not."
</p>

<p>
"Put your fingers like you had them when we walked
up.  That's the way of it.  This little one there and that
little one there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go on!" said Essie, but settled her fingers as
she was told.
</p>

<p>
"Rather nice just now, don't you think?" said Mr. Wriford.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad," said Essie.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we'll do it again?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the moon'll drop plump out of the sky."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll watch it," said Mr. Wriford, "and if it
doesn't we will.  Let's be friends, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we're friends, all right."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll pretend I'm your&mdash;young fellow.  How
about that?"
</p>

<p>
Essie gave a little laugh.  "Likely!" she said.  "You
know, I believe you're a caution after all, for all you're
so quiet.  My young fellow!  Why, I don't even know
your name&mdash;your Christian name, I mean."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"However do I know?  Shouldn't be a bit surprised
if it was Solomon."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it isn't.  What would you like it to be?"
</p>

<p>
Essie looked across the bandstand lights beneath
them for a moment, then made a little snuggling
movement with the hand in Mr. Wriford's, and then looked
at him and said softly: "Well, I've never had an
Arthur."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Arthur, then&mdash;so long as you don't make
it Art or Artie."
</p>

<p>
"What, don't you like Art, then?" said Essie, and
then suddenly, her eyes asparkle again, her lips
twitching, "Aren't names funny, though?  Let's have a
laugh!"
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Wriford laughed and said the name Edith
always made him think of seed cake; and Essie laughed
immensely and said Alice always reminded her of a
piece of silk; and Mr. Wriford said Ethel was a bit of
brown velvet; and Essie said Robert was a bouncing
foot-ball; and in this laughter and this childish folly
Mr. Wriford found himself immoderately tickled and
amused, and Essie quite forgot the disturbance that had
followed the kissing; and home when the band stopped
they went in quick exchange of lightsome subjects.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford, for the first time that he might have
remembered, went to bed and fell asleep without lying
long awake to think and think.
</p>

<p>
The significant thing was that he did not try to
remember it, nor reflect upon it.  He was smiling at an
absurdity of jolly little Essie's as he put out his light:
he was soon asleep.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
OUR ESSIE
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Walks with Essie are frequent now; and in the house
talk with Essie at all odd moments that bring them
together.  Jolly little Essie!  Mr. Wriford finds himself
often thinking of her as that, and for that quality
always seeking her when moodiness oppresses him.  Days
pass and there is a step in advance of this: good little
Essie!  Careless, he realises himself, of what mood he
takes to her.  He can be silent with her, depressed,
oppressed, thinking, puzzling: Essie never minds.  He
can be irritable with her and speak sharply to her:
Essie never minds.  Essie is content just to rattle along
and not be answered, or, if that seems to vex him
further, then just to occupy herself with those bright,
roving eyes of hers, and with those merry thoughts which
they pick up and reflect again in the movements of
those expressive lips.  Days pass and his thoughts of
her take yet a further step: pretty little Essie!&mdash;Essie
who likes to be kissed, who sees "no odds to it," who
likes to think somebody is fond of her!  She is jolly
little Essie&mdash;always cheers him: "Oh, Arthur!"
when for an hour he has not spoken a word, or speaking,
has snubbed her, "Oh, Arthur!  Just look at those
dogs chasing!  Oh, did you ever!  Aren't they funny,
though!  Let's have a laugh!"  She is good little
Essie&mdash;never minds: "Well, whatever's the odds to that?"
when sometimes he apologises for having been ungracious.
"I daresay I'm not half a nuisance, chattering,
when you want to be quiet.  Why, you're always quiet
though, aren't you?  I don't mind."  She is pretty little
Essie: "Oo-oo!" cries Essie.  "I say, though!" and
then, as on that first occasion, relaxes and gives him
those pretty, expressive lips of hers, and is warm and
soft and clinging in his arms; and then one day, when
in his kiss she detects some ardour, born, while he kisses
her, of a sudden gathering realisation of his frequent, his
advancing thoughts of her, says to him softly, snuggling
to him: "What, are you fond of me, Arthur?"
</p>

<p>
More swiftly than the space of the inspiration of a
single breath an idea springs, fixes, spreads within him.
It is determination of all his thought of her in their
advancing stages: it is swiftest look from that vacant
corner in the room of his life to Essie, always so jolly,
always so good, ah, so pretty, yielding in his arms.
Swift as a single breath it is.  Why should not Essie
fill that vacant place?
</p>

<p>
"What, are you fond of me, Arthur?"
</p>

<p>
Deep in his sudden thought he does not answer her.
What sees she responsive to her question in his eyes?
She sees that which makes her leave his grasp.
</p>

<p>
In her eyes he sees sudden moisture shining.
</p>

<p>
Deep in the sudden thought that has him&mdash;bemused
as one that, in earnest conversation with a friend, turns
bemusedly to address a remark to another, he says:
"Hulloa, you're not crying, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
"Likely!" says Essie, blinking.
</p>

<p>
"You are, though.  What's up?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the sun in my eyes."
</p>

<p>
"There's precious little sun."
</p>

<p>
Essie dabs her eyes with her handkerchief and gives
a little sniff.  "Well, there's precious little tears."
</p>

<p>
"Essie, you asked me if I was fond of you."
</p>

<p>
She turns upon him with sudden sharpness.  "More
fool me then."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  Essie, I am.  I'm very, very
fond of you."
</p>

<p>
"Come on," says Essie briskly.  "We'll be late.  I
was only having a game&mdash;so are you."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Here is a new idea for Mr. Wriford&mdash;come to him
suddenly, but, as now he sees, in process of coming
these many days.  Here is a new idea, completely
developed in that swift moment while Essie asked him:
"What, are you fond of me, Arthur?" but over whose
development now constantly he ponders&mdash;welding it,
shaping it, assuring himself of it in its every detail.
It is solution&mdash;no less&mdash;of what has hounded him
these many years.  It is discovery of what shall fill that
vacant place over which, in the quietude of these more
recent days, dispassionately he has puzzled.  Essie
the solution: Essie the thing that shall fill up the
vacancy.  He wonders he has not thought of it before.
Who, out of the turmoil, the hopelessness, the abject
misery in which he came here, who found him the
quietude?  Essie.  Who for the old grinding torments, the
abysmal fears, has exchanged him the dispassionate
wondering?  Essie.  Look, look upon the present state
that now is his, contrast it with the old, and seek who
is responsible.  Essie.  His early constraint in the
Bickers' household is vanished as completely as his
early miseries at the Tower House School.  He is
confident and at ease and actively interested when among
his boys.  Who showed him the way of it?  Essie.  In
the life behind the plumber's shop he is become very
intimately the "one of us like" that Mrs. Bickers, at their
first meeting, had told him they liked their lodgers to
be.  By whose agency?  Essie's.  Essie has told Mother
and Dad his name is Arthur and to call him Arthur: and
Arthur he is become, alike to the cert. plumber, who
delights to instruct him in the mysteries of plumbing
and often from his workshop in the yard hails him
"Arthur!  Arthur, come an' look at this here!  I'm
fixin' a new weight to a ball-tap;" and to Mrs. Bickers
who as often as not adds a "dear" to it and says:
"Arthur, dear, give over talking to Essie a minute an'
jus' see if you can't put that shop bell to rights like
Mr. Bickers showed you how.  It's out of order
again."  Who to this pleasant homeliness introduced him?
Essie.  Who supports him in its enjoyment?  Essie.
Who is the centre, the mainspring of this happy
household?  Essie.  Essie, Essie, Essie, jolly and good and
pretty little Essie!  He meets her at every thought.
She, she, supplies his moods at every turn!
</p>

<p>
Very well, then.  The school term at Tower House is
drawing to a close.  Scarcely a fortnight remains before
the holidays begin.  What then?
</p>

<p>
Ah, then the new thought that suddenly has come to
him.  In the quietude of mind, in the dispassionate
puzzlement upon what it is that he has missed in life&mdash;in
this convalescent attitude towards life that now is his
he has no desire to return, when the school term is
ended and he is unemployed, to the wandering, to the
hopeless quest that brought him here.  Why not
advance by Essie the quietude that by Essie he has found?
Why not by Essie fill the dispassionate puzzlement that
by Essie has become dispassionate where for so long it
had so cruelly been frenzied?  What if he went away
with Essie?  What if he took her away?  What if he so
far resumed touch with the prosperity that waited him
in London as to get money from his agent, due to him
for his successful novels, and go away with Essie&mdash;live
somewhere in retreat with Essie, have Essie for his own?
Why not?  No reason why.  It was fixed and determined
in his mind in that very instant when, as she
asked him "What, are you fond of me, Arthur?" it
came to him.
</p>

<p>
The more he thinks upon it the more completely it
attracts him....
</p>

<p>
He thinks upon it, and it attracts him, with no delusion
of what, if he acts upon it, it will give him.  It will
not give him positive happiness.  He would take Essie
away with no such delusion as that.  But strongly,
seductively, it offers him a negative peace.  With Essie
no need longer to brood on what it was in life that he
had missed: Essie who never minded, who always
brightened him, who then would be his own&mdash;Essie
would stifle that old hopeless yearning.  There would be
pleasure in money with Essie&mdash;pleasure in pleasing
her, in watching her delight in little things that it could
buy.  He first would travel on the Continent with
Essie, delighting in her delight at worlds of which she
had scarcely so much as heard.  How she would laugh
at funny foreigners and at funny foreign ways!  Then
he would settle down, take a house somewhere, live
quietly, take up his novel-writing again, have Essie
always to turn to when he wanted her, to minister to
him and entertain him, and have her&mdash;being Essie&mdash;at
his command to keep out of his way when he wished
to work, or perhaps to think&mdash;ah, for thoughts
sometimes still would come!&mdash;and not be worried.  Yes&mdash;jolly
little Essie, good little Essie&mdash;there was refuge,
refuge to be found with her!  Yes&mdash;pretty little Essie&mdash;she
was desirable, desirable, desirable to him!  Yes,
let it be done!  Yes, let him immediately set about the
accomplishment of it!
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
His purpose was no sooner definitely fixed, than in
the way of its fulfilment practical difficulties began to
arise.  They arose in form of scruples.  He intended no
harm to Essie.  She never should suffer in smallest
degree, by word or act, in giving herself to him.  But
to marry her never&mdash;at the first making of his purpose&mdash;so
much as crossed his mind.  A little later this
aspect of his moral intentions towards her came up in
his thoughts&mdash;and marriage he at once dismissed as
altogether subversive of that very peace of mind he
anticipated in having her for his own.  To marry her,
as he saw it, were an irrevocable and dreadful step that
immediately would return him to new torments, new
despair.  Bound for life to such as Essie was, not loving
her, only very fond of her, very grateful to her&mdash;why,
the bond would terrify him and goad him as much as
ever he was terrified and goaded by the bonds and
responsibilities of the London days from which in frenzy
he had fled.  Misery for him and, knowing himself,
he knew that he would visit it in misery upon her.
Panic at what he had done would fill him, consume him
in all the dreadful forms in which he knew his panics,
directly he had done it.  He would hate her.  Despite
himself, despite his fondness for her, despite all she had
given him and could give him, despite all these, if he
were bound to her he would be unkind to her, cruel to
her.  Merely and without bond to have her for his own
presented his Essie&mdash;his jolly little Essie, good little
Essie, pretty little Essie&mdash;on a footing immeasurably
different.  That very fact of being responsible for her
without being bound to her would alone&mdash;and without
his happiness in her&mdash;assure her of his constant care,
his unfailing protection always and always.  Natured
as he was&mdash;or as he had become in the days of his
stress&mdash;he thought of bondage as utterly intolerable
to him.  No; marriage was worse than unthinkable,
marriage was to lose&mdash;and worse than lose&mdash;the very
happiness upon which now he was determined.
</p>

<p>
Yet scruples came.
</p>

<p>
He had not the smallest doubt of winning Essie to
his intentions&mdash;Essie who liked to think somebody
was fond of her, who liked to be kissed, who had
confessed of the lodgers that "most of 'em had"&mdash;who,
in fact, was Essie Bickers.  He knew, thinking upon it,
what had been in pretty little Essie's heart when she
said softly: "What, are you fond of me, Arthur?"  He
knew it was that she loved him.  He knew what had
been in her heart when, having said it, she drew away
from him, and he knew why as she drew away he had
seen tears in her eyes.  He knew it was because, having
made her confession of love, she had seen no response
of love in his eyes that only were bemused with sudden
thought upon his sudden plan.  He knew he had only
to tell her that she was wrong, that indeed he loved her.
Yet scruples came.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
He set about his plans.  On the morning when but a
week remained to the end of the term&mdash;the date he
had fixed in his mind&mdash;he wrote before he came down
to breakfast a letter to his agent in London.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"DEAR LESSINGHAM,
</p>

<p class="letter">
"I'm still alive!  I've been wandering&mdash;getting back
my health.  I was rather run down.  Now, very soon,
I hope to get to work again.  Keep it to yourself that
you've heard of me again.  I'll be seeing you soon.
Meanwhile, you've got a pile of money for me, haven't
you?  I want you, please, to send me at once £200 in
£10 notes to this address.  I'm going abroad for a bit.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Yours ever,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"PHILIP WRIFORD."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Funny to be in touch with that world again!  He put
the letter in his pocket.  He would post it on his way to
school.  Imagine Essie's eyes when she saw all that
wealth!  He could hear her cry&mdash;he imagined himself
showing it to her in a first-class carriage bound for
London&mdash;"Oh, Arthur!  Did you ever, though!"
</p>

<p>
Smiling upon that thought, he went down-stairs to
the parlour; and it was thus, at the very moment as
it were of first putting out his hand to take Essie, that
scruples came.
</p>

<p>
He found Mrs. Bickers seated alone.  There were
sounds of Essie gaily humming as she prepared
breakfast in the kitchen.  Mrs. Bickers, busily sewing, looked
up and smiled at him.  "Good morning, Arthur.  I
declare I do like to see you come down of a morning
smiling like that.  Busy, aren't I?  So early, too!" and
she held up what looked to be a blouse that she was
making, and told him: "That's for our Essie!"
</p>

<p>
The smile went from his face and from his thoughts.
"Our Essie!"  Only now that phrase, and what it
meant, entered his calculations on his purpose; and with
it the thought of his smiles which Mrs. Bickers had been
so glad to see&mdash;and what they meant.
</p>

<p>
He desired to turn the conversation; yet even as he
made answer he knew his words were leading him deeper
into it.  "Why, you're not surprised to see me smiling,
are you, Mrs. Bickers?" he said.  "This is what I call
a very smiling house, you know."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers set down her work on her lap and
smiled anew.  "Well, that's good news," she said.
"Ah, and it's not always been either, Arthur."
</p>

<p>
"Hasn't it, Mrs. Bickers?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, it hasn't!  Why, Mr. Bickers and me we
had a heap of trouble one time."
</p>

<p>
"But you're very happy now?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been happy," said Mrs. Bickers, smiling again,
"eighteen years and three&mdash;four&mdash;eighteen years and
four months."
</p>

<p>
"That means ever since something?"
</p>

<p>
"Ever since our Essie came," said Mrs. Bickers softly.
</p>

<p>
Our Essie!  Ah!  He said dully: "Yes, you must be
fond of Essie?"
</p>

<p>
"Fond!" Mrs. Bickers echoed him.  "Why, Arthur,
she's all the world to Mr. Bickers an' me, our Essie.
She's such a bright one!  Our Essie came to us very
late in life, and you know I reckon we've never had a
minute's trouble since.  Looking back on what we'd
had before, that's why we say, Mr. Bickers an' me,
that we reckon she was a gift sent straight out of
heaven.  We're sure of it.  Brought up with old folk like
us, she'd grow up quiet and odd like some children are,
wouldn't you think?  Or likely enough discontented,
finding it dull?  But you've only got to look at our
Essie to feel happy.  There's not many can say that of a
daughter, not for every bit of eighteen years, Arthur.
We reckon we're uncommon blessed, Mr. Bickers an' me."
</p>

<p>
In comes Essie with a steaming dish: "Oh, these
sausages, Mother!  Jus' look at them sizzling!  Oh,
aren't they funny, though!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He does not post his letter on the way to school.
He does not post it on the way back from school.  He
carries it up-stairs again in his pocket when he goes to
bed.  Scruples!
</p>

<p>
Scruples&mdash;he lies awake and reasons the scruples;
he tosses restlessly and damns the scruples.  Scruples!
In the morning he has settled them.  He rises very early
before the house is astir.  He comes down to post his
letter and goes at once through the back yard which
offers nearer way to the letter-box.
</p>

<p>
"Hulloa, Arthur!  Why, you're up early!"
</p>

<p>
This time it is Mr. Bickers, hailing him through the
open door of his workshop where he is busily occupied
with blow-flame and soldering-irons.
</p>

<p>
"Well, not so early as you, Mr. Bickers.  I thought
I was first for once."
</p>

<p>
The cert. plumber laughs, evidently well-pleased.
"Come along in an' give a hand.  Soldering, this is.
Me!  I'm never abed after five o'clock summer-times."
</p>

<p>
"I often think you're wonderfully young for your
years, Mr. Bickers."
</p>

<p>
Another laugh of satisfaction.  "I'm younger than I
was a score years back; and that's a fact, Arthur."
</p>

<p>
"What's the secret of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why," says Mr. Bickers, "there is a secret to it,
sure enough.  It's this way, Arthur.  Now you put the
solder-pot on the lamp again.  There's matches.  This
way&mdash;I was fifty-two years growing old, and I've been
close on nineteen years growing young.  Ever
since&mdash;  Hullo! careful with it!"
</p>

<p>
"Ever since&mdash;?" says Mr. Wriford, his head
averted, fumbling with the lamp, fumbling with his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Ever since our Essie came to us."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says Mr. Wriford, and adds "Yes, that's
much what Mrs. Bickers was telling me only yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's the same with both of us," says Mr. Bickers;
and then changes his voice to the voice that
Mr. Wriford recognises for that in which he reads the
scriptural portions at night.  "You mark this from me,
Arthur," Mr. Bickers continues.  "You're a young
man.  You mark what I tell you&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Necessary to face Mr. Bickers while he tells&mdash;to
face that serene old countenance, those steady eyes,
that earnest voice.  "Prayers aren't always answered
the way you expect, Arthur.  You'll find that.  There's
man's way of reckoning how a thing ought to be done,
and there's God's way.  We'd had uncommon trouble,
Mrs. Bickers an' me, a score years back, and we
prayed our ways for to ease it.  Essie came.  God's
way.  Our Essie come to us a blessing straight out of
heaven."
</p>

<p>
Necessary to face him, necessary to hear in his voice,
to see in his eyes, to watch in the radiation that fills
up the careworn lines about his mouth and on his
brow&mdash;necessary to hear and to see there what "Our Essie"
means to him.
</p>

<p>
Necessary to say something....  To say what?
Mr. Wriford can only find the words he said yesterday
to Mrs. Bickers.  He says: "Yes, you must be fond of
Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Fond!" says Mr. Bickers.  "I'll tell you this to it,
Arthur.  I'll tell you just what our Essie is to us.
There's a verse we say night and morning, Mrs. Bickers
an' me, when we're returning thanks for our blessing:
'Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the
dayspring from on high hath visited us.'  That's our
Essie."
</p>

<p>
The dayspring from on high!  Irreverent, in Mr. Wriford's
dim recollection of the text, in its application
to Essie.  He tries to laugh at it.  How laugh at it?
Dayspring&mdash;ah, that is she!  She is that in her
perpetual vitality, in her bubbling, ceaseless, bottomless
well of spirits.  She is that to him, and therefore he
requires her, requires her.  Ah, she is that to them!
Scruples&mdash;scruples&mdash;infernal scruples&mdash;ridiculous
scruples.  He means no harm to her.  God knows he
means nothing but happiness to her.  Yet the day
passes.  He defers his intention to post his letter till
after breakfast.  He goes to school and defers it till the
luncheon hour.  He goes then for a walk and defers
it till he is coming home.  He comes home and brings
his letter with him.
</p>

<p>
Scruples&mdash;damn them!  Scruples&mdash;damn himself
for entertaining them!
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
NOT TO DECEIVE HER
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Let Essie decide!  That is the decision to which he
comes, with which he stills his scruples.  He desires her.
The more he reflects upon possession of her&mdash;his to
amuse him, to run his house that he will take for her,
to make him laugh, not to interfere with him, requiring
nothing from him but what he shall choose to give her&mdash;the
more he visions this prospect, the more ardently
it attracts him.  There he sees that vacant place in his
life filled up; there he sees sufficiently attained the
secret of happiness that he has missed; there, belonging
to him, he sees her&mdash;jolly little Essie&mdash;filling, hiding,
forgetting him his endless quest, his hopeless hopelessness,
his old-time miserable misery.  He cannot marry
her.  He does not love her.  He could not be mated&mdash;for
life!&mdash;to such as she in all her funny little phrases
reveals herself to be.  He only wants her.  Then come
the scruples.  Well, let Essie decide!  She shall know
his every intention, his every feeling.  He will not even
so far delude her as to tell her he loves her.  If she who
loves him is willing to go with him, what need matter
Mr. and Mrs. Bickers with their devotion to our Essie?
What are they to him?  Why should they interfere
with his life?  What are they to Essie if he&mdash;as he will
be&mdash;is everything to her?  And then, with "Let Essie
decide," he finally crushes under foot all of scruples,
all of conscience, that remain after this review of his
resolve: finally, for this is his last and comforting and
confident resolve&mdash;that if Essie is shocked and frightened
and will not, he will immediately accept it: whatever
the temptation will nothing deceive or trick her,
not by so much as a look pretend he loves her, immediately
leave her and immediately return to the old hopelessness,
the old quest, the old emptiness of all his former years.
</p>

<p>
Decided!  His scruples stilled!  Himself assured,
absolved!  Let Essie decide it.  Now to act.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
This is Thursday.  He has carried that letter nearly
a week unposted in his pocket.  To-morrow the Tower
House School breaks up.  On Saturday Mrs. Bickers
and Essie are going for a three weeks' summer holiday
to Whitecliffe Sands, which is an hour away on the
Norfolk coast, and it has been decided a month before that
he is to accompany them for their first week as
Mrs. Bickers' guest.  The kindly invitation had been made,
and he had gratefully accepted it, in the period before
this sudden thought of filling with Essie that vacant
corner in the room of his life: in the period when he
had been content dispassionately to drift along until
the holidays should terminate his engagement&mdash;dispassionately
to leave till then conjecture upon what
he next should do.
</p>

<p>
This summer visit to Whitecliffe Sands was, as he
then learned, an annual excursion.  Mr. Bickers stays
with the shop, but closes it and comes down to mother
and Essie every Saturday until Monday.  When only
that month remained before the holiday came, discussion
of the subject became Essie's chief topic of conversation
at supper every evening; all aglitter it made her
with reminiscences of Whitecliffe's past delights and
with anticipations of its fond excitements now to be
renewed: the pier that has been opened since last
summer, the concert party that will reopen its season there
just before they arrive, the progress she has made and
means to make in swimming, the white shoes she is
going to buy, the new coat and skirt that she and mother
are making because "My goodness, you don't have to
look half smart on the parade, evenings!"
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this had come one evening
Mrs. Bickers' "What about Arthur?" and then, to his
rather rueful smile and announcement that he had no
plans as yet beyond the end of the term, her kindly
proposal, evidently arranged beforehand with
Mr. Bickers: "Well, I tell you what would be very nice,
Arthur dear, that is, if you haven't got another job of
work immediately by then.  Me and Mr. Bickers have
had a talk about it.  We'd like you to come with Essie
an' me jus' till Mr. Bickers comes down after our first
week.  There's his nice room you could have in our
lodgings, and you'd be just our guest like.  A nice blow
by the sea would do you a world of good, an' nice for
our Essie to have a companion."
</p>

<p>
Essie had clapped her hands in immense delight:
he had accepted with marks in his eyes and voice of a
return of that sense of being overwhelmed by this
household's kindness that in the early days here often
overwhelmed him.  Now he set his teeth against
consideration of that aspect.  Let Essie decide!  He might take
her away to-morrow or on Saturday morning: it might
be easier to wait and slip off one day from Whitecliffe.
Let Essie decide!
</p>

<p>
That evening he asked her.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The night was fine for a stroll after supper.  They
passed together up the main street of the town towards
the Gardens&mdash;Essie desperately excited with the
immediate nearness of Whitecliffe and attracted by all
the shops in case there was something she had not yet
bought for the holiday: himself revolving in his mind
how best to open his proposal.  He wished to do it at
once.  He found it very difficult to begin.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, those parasols!" cried Essie, stopping before
a brightly-illuminated window.  "Do stop, Arthur.
That sort of blue one with lace!  Did you ever!
Wouldn't I like that for Whitecliffe though!  Can you
see the ticket?  Nine-an'-eleven-three!  Oh, talk about
dear!"
</p>

<p>
"That's not really expensive, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"My goodness, it is for me, though.  Ten shillings,
Arthur!"
</p>

<p>
"Essie, would you like to be rich?"
</p>

<p>
"Oo, wouldn't I just!"
</p>

<p>
"What would you say if I was rich, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
Essie turned away from the coveted sunshade and
laughed delightedly at him.  "Goodness, wouldn't it
be funny!  I'd say what ho!  What <i>ho</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Essie, I want to tell you something.  I am rich.
I'm what you'd call very rich."
</p>

<p>
"Picked up a shilling, have you?" cried Essie,
gleefully entering into the game.  "Let's go into the bank
and invest it!"
</p>

<p>
"No, we'll go in here," said Mr. Wriford, the contents
of a bookseller's window they had reached giving
him a sudden idea.  "We'll go in here.  I'll show you
something."
</p>

<p>
She caught his arm as he stepped towards the door.
"Whatever do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
He answered her very intensely, "Essie, be serious.
I've a lot to tell you to-night.  First of all, I'm rich,
I've only been pretending all the time I've been down
here.  My name's not Arthur at all.  It's Philip&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Essie made a laughing grimace.  "Ur!  Philip's like
skim milk."
</p>

<p>
Unheeding her, he went on.  "Philip Wriford.  I'm
an author&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if you aren't a caution!" cried Essie.
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe it?"
</p>

<p>
Essie assumed a very ingenuous air.  "Your mistake,
pardon me.  I wasn't born jus' before supper, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Will you believe it if I go in here and ask to see
some of my books?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wouldn't I like to see you dare!"
</p>

<p>
"Come along," and he stepped inside the porch of
the shop and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
Essie, half-laughing, half-frightened at this boldness,
clutched at his arm.  He caught her hand and led her
within.  "Oh, if you aren't a caution to-night!" Essie
whispered.  "Don't, Arthur!  Arthur, don't be so bold!"
</p>

<p>
"You've got to believe."
</p>

<p>
A counter at the end of the shop displayed above it
the words "Lending Library."  Essie, most terribly
red in the face, followed him while he stalked to it, and
then stood confounded with his boldness and striving
immensely to restrain her laughter while Mr. Wriford
addressed the young woman who came towards them.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any of Philip Wriford's books in the
library?" Mr. Wriford asked her.
</p>

<p>
"We've got several copies," he was told.  "But
they're all out.  There's a great demand for them."
</p>

<p>
His eye caught the top volume of a pile of books on
the counter, from each of which a ticket was displayed,
and he motioned towards it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's his last," the young woman said, "but
it's ordered.  It's going out to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I can look at it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can look at it.  If you like to take out a
subscription by the week or longer, you can put your
name down for it.  There's other copies out," and she
moved away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wriford took up the book with something of a
thrill&mdash;the first actively stirring thought of his work
since he had fled from it.  It was the book he had
delivered to his agent shortly before that night of his escape,
and had seen ecstatically reviewed in the paper at
Pendra.  He had never seen it in print.  He opened it at
the title page.  "Twelfth Edition," he read aloud to
Essie.  "You know what that means.  It was only
published in the autumn."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" said Essie.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I wrote it.  I tell you I'm Philip Wriford."
</p>

<p>
The young woman's departure permitted Essie to
relieve her laughter.  "Oh, Arthur, do not!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you it's true."  He turned to the opening
chapter and began with very strange sensations to read
what he had written in days separated from the present
by illimitable gulfs of new identity.  The cunning of
his own hand, thus separated from the identity that
now read the words, was abundantly apparent to him.
There was a nervous and arresting force in the first
paragraph, a play of wit above a searching philosophy,
that called up and strongly attracted his literary
appreciation, dormant beneath the stresses of his past
months.
</p>

<p>
Occupied, for the moment he forgot Essie standing
by his side.  Her voice recalled her to him.  She was
reading over his shoulder, and reaching the end of the
paragraph, spoke her opinion.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it silly, though!" said Essie.
</p>

<p>
He closed the book and put it down and turned to
her and looked at her.  "Do you think so?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't you?" cried Essie.  "I never read such
ridiculous nonsense.  I'm sure if you were an author,
Arthur, you couldn't write such silly stuff as that."
</p>

<p>
He laughed a trifle vexedly.  "Come along," he said,
and laughed again, this time to himself and with better
humour, as they came into the street and turned towards
the Gardens.  He could appreciate the blow at his
conceit: further, this little scene was illuminating
demonstration of the gulf social and intellectual between
himself and Essie, and somehow that approved him in his
intentions towards her: what vexed him now was only
the failure of this sudden plan to inform Essie of his
position in life and so to give him opening for the
proposal he intended.
</p>

<p>
The bookseller's was the last shop in the High Street.
They had entered the Gardens before Essie, consumed
with laughter, could find words for comment.  Then
she said: "Oh, Arthur, if you weren't a fair caution!
I'd never have thought it of you!"
</p>

<p>
"You don't believe it?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course I don't!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've got to believe somehow that I've got
a lot of money."
</p>

<p>
"Daresay I can believe the moon is made of green
cheese if I try hard enough.  I say, though, serious,
whatever for have I got to believe you're rich?"
</p>

<p>
It was the desired opening.  He slipped his hand
beneath her arm.  "Because I want to spend it on you,
Essie.  I want to make you happy with me."
</p>

<p>
He felt and heard her sharply catch her breath.  He
looked down at her and saw her eyes dim and her face
suffuse in sudden rush of colour.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Arthur!" Essie said and caught her breath
again.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go up to our seat, Essie."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
In silence up to their seat, and on their seat a little
space in silence.  She first to speak.  She, while he sat
determining how best to tell her, turned to him eyes
starry as the stars that lit them, in which still and deeper
yet he saw the moisture that had dimmed them a moment
before, and still, and cloudier yet, her face all
cloudy red.
</p>

<p>
She said very softly: "What, have you proposed to
me, Arthur, dear?"
</p>

<p>
He was prepared for anything but that.  He was
reassuring himself, while they waited in that silence,
upon his resolution not to deceive her, not even to
pretend he loved her as she understood love, upon his
determination, for his honour and for hers (so he
convinced himself), straitly, without deception, without
temptation, to throw all the burden of decision upon
her love for him.  This "What, have you proposed to
me?" took him unawares.  It caught him so unexpectedly
that, of its very unexpectedness, it threw out of
him its own response where, had he first imagined such
a question, to fashion answers to it had filled him with
confusion, nay, with dismay.
</p>

<p>
Its own response!  It came to him as a question so
ludicrously odd, so blundering, so inept, ah, so
characteristic of jolly little Essie's funny little ways, that
he gave a little laugh, and put his arm about her
shoulders, and playfully squeezed her to him and laughed
again and exclaimed "Essie!"
</p>

<p>
The softness left her voice, the dimness her eyes.
"Oh, aren't I glad!" cried Essie and snuggled against
him and said: "Oh, hasn't it come all of a sudden,
though!"
</p>

<p>
Her funny little ways!  Close she was against him&mdash;jolly
to hold her thus: his arm about her, her face close
beneath his own, his other hand that held her hand
caressing her soft warm cheek&mdash;his dear, his jolly
little Essie.  But not to deceive her!  Let him hold to
that.  Let her be told in her own opportunity that
which he has to tell.  Let him lead her towards it.
</p>

<p>
He asked her&mdash;avoiding her question, not confirming
her exclamation&mdash;"Do you love me, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
She wriggled herself closer up to him, and laughed
at him with those soft expressive lips and with those
eyes of hers, and said "Oh, love you!" as though love
were too ridiculously poor a word.
</p>

<p>
"Put up with me, Essie&mdash;always?  You know what
I am sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Put up with you!" cried Essie, and again the wriggle
and again the laugh, and then said "What a way to
talk!" and by a movement of her face towards his own
made as if to kiss such talk away.
</p>

<p>
He kept himself from that.  Not to deceive her!
"Suppose I made you miserable, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
"However could you?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose I did?  You know how I get sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Mean when you're quiet?" said Essie, snuggling.
"Of course you're quiet sometimes, aren't you?  My
goodness, I don't mind.  I'd just have a jolly laugh by
myself."
</p>

<p>
Her funny little ways!  He was fighting against them.
They urged him that they were in themselves just what
attracted him&mdash;always to have them to turn to in his
moodiness.  Ah, not to deceive her!  He said heavily:
"I don't mean that, Essie.  Suppose&mdash;suppose I made
you more miserable than that?  Suppose I told you
something that made you think I couldn't be fond of
you?"
</p>

<p>
She asked him quickly: "What, been engaged before,
have you?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been lots of things.  I'm going to tell you."
</p>

<p>
He felt her stiffen.  "I only want to hear this one.
Why didn't you marry her?"
</p>

<p>
"I think because she wouldn't marry me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear!" cried Essie, and wriggled.  "Isn't this
awful!  Oh, don't I hate her, though!  Whyever wouldn't
she?"
</p>

<p>
Here was a way to tell her.  What if it meant to lose
her?  Here was the opportunity.  Let him hold to his
vow!  He said deeply: "Essie, because she knew me
too well.  She knew some of what you've got to know,
Essie.  She'd tell you."
</p>

<p>
"Like her to try!" said Essie and sat up with a jerk.
</p>

<p>
He could face her now.  There she was, his jolly little
Essie, looking so fierce, breathing so quickly.  Tell her
and lose her?  Clasp her and kiss away that angry little
frown?  Not to deceive her!  Hold, hold to that!  He
began: "She'd tell you&mdash;what I've got to tell you.
She'd tell you&mdash;listen to me, Essie.  What would you
do if she told you I'd make you&mdash;or anybody&mdash;unhappy?
That I'm all&mdash;all wrong, all moods, all utterly
impossible?  Essie, that I can't love anybody really&mdash;not
even you?  That I'm not to be trusted?  That I
can't trust myself?  That I'd marry and then&mdash;then
pretty well go mad to think I was married and do
anything to get out of it?  That all I want, that what I
want, Essie, is&mdash;is not exactly to marry?  Essie, do
you understand?  That so long as I felt free,
perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I'd be all right&mdash;perhaps be kind?"
</p>

<p>
He stopped.  She was sitting bolt upright, staring
straight before her into the night, her pretty lips
compressed, and he could hear her breathing&mdash;short and
quick and sharp.
</p>

<p>
He said: "Essie, what would you do&mdash;what would
you do if she told you that?"
</p>

<p>
She turned sharply towards him.  "Do?" cried
Essie.  He could see how she quivered.  "I tell you
what I'd do!  I'd take my hand and I'd give her such
a slap in the face as she wouldn't forget in a hurry, I
know!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed despite himself.  But he cried: "If it
was true, Essie?  If it was true?"
</p>

<p>
"Give her another!" said Essie.  "Such a one!"
</p>

<p>
Her funny little ways!  He gave an exclamation and
caught her to him.  She was rigid in her indignant heat.
He clasped her and turned her face to his.  "Oo-oo!"
cried Essie, "Oo-oo!" and relaxed, and snuggled, and
put her mouth to his.  He laughed freely&mdash;bitterly&mdash;recklessly.
How treat her as others than her class
should be treated?  Why treat her so?  He cried:
"Essie, you're impossible!" and squeezed her in reproof
of her and in helpless desire of her, and cried: "Essie!
Essie!  Essie!"
</p>

<p>
She laughed and clung to him; laughed and kissed
him kiss for kiss.  She said presently, only murmuring,
so close their lips: "Wouldn't I just though!  Hard
as I could I'd fetch her such a couple of slaps!  Oo-oo!
Oh, I say, Arthur!  Why, I never heard such things!
I never heard such a caution as she must have been!
Jus' because you're quiet, dear&mdash;that's what it was.
One of that fast lot.  That's what she was.  Don't I
know them, though!"
</p>

<p>
He was just holding her, kissing her, laughing at her.
Why not?  He'd not wrong her till she understood&mdash;that
was his new assurance.  At Whitecliffe he'd take
her, and tell her there so that not possibly she'd
misunderstand him.  Not to deceive her&mdash;he'd not
deceived her yet.
</p>

<p>
Swiftly deception came.
</p>

<p>
"Won't we be happy though!"
</p>

<p>
"Won't we!" he answered her.
</p>

<p>
"Won't I take care of you just!"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I want, Essie!  That's what I want!"
</p>

<p>
"Quiet as you like, dear.  I shan't mind.".
</p>

<p>
"Essie, I'll make you happy&mdash;happy."
</p>

<p>
"Just think of Mother and Dad when we tell them!
They aren't half fond of you, Mother and Dad."
</p>

<p>
The beginning of it.  "We won't tell them&mdash;yet,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"What, have a secret?"
</p>

<p>
"Just for a day or two&mdash;just till Whitecliffe."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't that fine, though, to have it a secret by
ourselves!"
</p>

<p>
"Fine, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Not long though.  I couldn't keep it above a week!"
</p>

<p>
"Just a week, Essie."
</p>

<p>
She was silent a moment, her lips on his.  And very
silent he.
</p>

<p>
She said: "You're not really rich, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you only said it&mdash;just because.  I know
how things pop out.  That doesn't matter.  Look, I
shouldn't be half surprised if Dad'll give you a job of
work in his shop when he knows we're engaged."
</p>

<p>
"It's true, Essie.  Rich as rich."
</p>

<p>
"You've never got as much as fifty pounds?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaps more than that."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if ever!  We'll never have a jolly little house
of our own?"
</p>

<p>
"We will, though.  A jolly one."
</p>

<p>
Silent again.  She was smiling, dreaming.  And silent
he.  He was thinking, thinking.  A striking clock
disturbed her.  "Eleven!  Oh, would you believe it!  If
we don't hurry, we'll have to tell them&mdash;to explain."
</p>

<p>
"We'll hurry," he said; and he added: "We must
keep our secret, Essie."
</p>

<p>
She was out of his arms in her surprise at the hour.
Something in his voice made her look at him quickly.
"There, you're quiet now&mdash;like you are sometimes,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
He told her "I'm thinking&mdash;of you."
</p>

<p>
At that she suddenly was in his arms again, her hands
about his neck.  "There's one thing," she whispered
and drew down his face.  "Oh, there's one thing!"
</p>

<p>
He asked her "What?"
</p>

<p>
"Jus' tell me how you love me.  You've not said it."
</p>

<p>
Not to deceive her!  "As if I need, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
"But I want you to.  Jus' say it so I can remember
it."
</p>

<p>
Not to deceive her!  He stroked her face.  "As if I
need, Essie!  Why should you want me to?"
</p>

<p>
She told him: "Well, but of course you need.  Of
course I want you to.  Oh, isn't that jus' what a girl
wants to hear, Arthur?  Why, haven't I laid awake at
night, loving you over and over, and thought how it
would be to hear you say it!  Do jus' say it to me,
dear."
</p>

<p>
Not to deceive her!&mdash;not even to pretend he loved
her as she understood love!  Ah, here at the stake was
his vow&mdash;caught, brought at last to the burning.
Evasions had saved it, hidden it, preserved it to him
unbroken: here it was dragged to the open.  As he had
nerved himself to try to tell her, so now he strengthened
himself to hold to his resolution.  Ah, as at enticement
of her funny little ways he could not resist her, so now,
by sudden yearning in her cry, fear to lose her overcame
him.  She suddenly had change of her fresh young
voice; she suddenly, as he waited, and she felt his arms
relax, most passionately was pressed against him, and
suddenly, with a break, in a cry, entreatingly besought
him: "Ah, do jus' put your arms around me, dear,
and hold me close and say you love me.  Do!"
</p>

<p>
Why not?  How not?  Thrice fool, thrice fool to
hesitate!  These that she asked were only words, and all
his plans and all his happiness at stake upon them.
This not the deeper step&mdash;nothing irrevocable here.
Who, with such as Essie, would scruple as he scrupled?
Who such a fool?  Who had suffered of life as he had
suffered?  Who, in his case, would hold away relief as
he was holding it?  She should decide.  He'd hold to
that.  By God, by God, he'd seal her to him first!
</p>

<p>
He said: "I love you, Essie."
</p>

<p>
Holding her, he could feel the sigh she gave run
through her as though all her spirit trembled in her
ecstasy.  She whispered: "Put your face down on
mine."
</p>

<p>
He put his cheek to hers.  Her cheek was wet.
</p>

<p>
"Are you crying, Essie?"
</p>

<p>
She pressed closer to him.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you crying?"
</p>

<p>
She murmured: "Well, haven't I wanted this!  Isn't
it what I've always wanted!  Say it again, dear.  With
your face on mine and with your arms around me say it."
</p>

<p>
"I love you, Essie."
</p>

<p>
Only words&mdash;no harm in that.  Only words!  At
Whitecliffe he'd tell her, and she, as he'd sworn, should
decide.  Only words&mdash;only words, but he'd not lose
her now!
</p>

<p>
As they walked home, he posted his letter.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
THE DREAM
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
"Registered letter for you," cried Essie.  "My
goodness if there isn't!"
</p>

<p>
This was in the little sitting-room of the Whitecliffe
Sands lodgings&mdash;the fifth morning there; Mr. Bickers
expected on the morrow; Mr. Wriford, as had been
arranged when he was invited for the blow by the sea
that would do him a world of good, supposed to be
leaving on the same day; and Essie, as they walked the
parade together before breakfast, in highest state of
excitement and mystification at Arthur's insistence that
their secret should be kept till then and then should
be revealed&mdash;if Essie wished it.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but aren't you a tease, though!" said Essie
delightedly, as this was repeated while they came in to
where the registered letter awaited them on the
breakfast-table.  "Aren't you a fair tease!  'If I want to!'  Why,
aren't I simply dying to just!  I'm simply bursting
to tell Mother every single minute.  Isn't a secret
a caution though&mdash;just like when you've got a hole
in your dress and think everybody's looking at it.  Oh,
isn't it funny how you do when you have, though?  Let's
have a laugh!"
</p>

<p>
The laughter brought them to the registered letter
and to Essie's exclamation at it; and then, as she
handled the packet, readdressed in Mr. Bickers' clerkly
script, and gave it to Mr. Wriford: "Feels to me as if
some one's sent you a pocket-handkerchief," said Essie.
</p>

<p>
"That shows you don't know what a honeymoon
ticket feels like," said Mr. Wriford and fingered the
bundle of banknotes within their parchment cover.
"Listen to the crinkling.  That's the confetti they
always pack it in."
</p>

<p>
Essie was highly amused.  "Hasn't being engaged
made you different, though!  You're jolly as anything
down here.  Aren't I glad!"
</p>

<p>
"It's you that's made me different," Mr. Wriford
declared; and "Oo-oo!" cried Essie at what went with
this assurance.  "Oo-oo!  Look out, here's Mother
coming."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Bickers' appearance, and then all the jolly
chatter at breakfast, and afterwards the morning bathe and
the rest of the usual programme of Whitecliffe's delights,
caused the mysterious registered letter to go&mdash;as she
would have said&mdash;clean out of Essie's head.  Mr. Wriford,
when he had a moment alone, opened it and
read it, and found within it, thrice repeated, a phrase
that intensely he chorused as he put letter and the
twenty ten-pound notes in his pockets and looked upon
the immediate plans that now were all ripe for execution.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>

<p>
"Your return to life" was this phrase that the literary
agent three times repeated in the course of his
enthusiastic delight and surprise at news at last of missing
Mr. Wriford.  He gave some astonishing figures of the
sales of Mr. Wriford's books.  He put forward what
appeared to him the most engaging of the contracts
which publishers were longing to make.  He ended with
How soon would Mr. Wriford run up to town for a
talk? or should Mr. Lessingham come down?  "Don't let
your return to life&mdash;now that at last you have made
it&mdash;give me a moment's longer silence than you can
help."
</p>

<p>
"Return to life"&mdash;that was the phrase.  Essie's
words&mdash;"Hasn't being engaged made you different,
though?"&mdash;that was the illustration of it.  Return to
life!  Ay, that was it, ay, that was his, far, far more
truly, with wonder of rebirth immeasurably more, than
ever Lessingham or any one in all the world could know.
There was thrill in that very thought that none but
himself knew its heights, its volume, its singing, its
radiant intensity.  That knowledge was his own as in
the immediate future his life was to be his own&mdash;life
without a care, life without a tie, life of complete
abandonment to pleasure of work, to pleasure of sheer
pleasure, to pleasure of jolly little Essie always to turn to, to
look after, to make happy, and yet always to know of
her that if he wished&mdash;he never would so wish&mdash;he
could be rid of her: no tie, no bond&mdash;happiness,
freedom; freedom, happiness!
</p>

<p>
This was the state to which, with a sudden, ecstatic
soaring as it were, he had swung away from the evening
of saying "I love you, Essie," and of posting his letter,
through these laughing days at Whitecliffe Sands, to
now when arrival of the honeymoon ticket made him
all ready for the final step.  Once that declaration of
the love he did not feel&mdash;as Essie understood love&mdash;had
been made, his scrupulous withholding from it lay
strewn about his feet as matter of no more regard than
the torn wrappings of a casket from which there has
been taken a very precious prize.  That declaration
sealed her to him; and through those intervening days
while the letter was awaited, constantly he repeated
it, constantly embellished it.  He mocked, he almost
upbraided himself for his old scruples at it.  Why, it
was her due, her right, he told himself.  She should be
happy with him&mdash;that was his resolve: never should
regret, never suffer.  Why, how possibly could she be
happy, how avoid pains of regret, if she were not
assured that he loved her?
</p>

<p>
So he gave her this bond&mdash;that was her due&mdash;of
his love; so with each day, each hour, each moment of
Whitecliffe in her company he became more and more
assured of her.  Assured!  He was convinced.  There
was not a glance from her eyes, not a sound from her
lips, not a touch of her hand but informed him that she
was his to do with as he would, come any test that he
might put her to.  Return to life!  Why, this freedom,
this happiness, was but the threshold of it.  Return to
life!  He imaged all the darkness he had come through
and damned it in exultant triumph at all its terrors
trampled under foot: night, darker than deepest
summer darkness here, he had known; day, of which these
burning cloudless days of holiday were sign and symbol,
now was his, and brighter still awaited him....
</p>

<p>
Whitecliffe Sands, anxious to present to its visitors
every attraction and convenience that may place it
among rising seaside resorts, numbers among the latter
a Tourist Bureau in the High Street where, so an
inscription informs you, you may book in advance to any
railway station in the British Isles.  On the morning
of the arrival of the registered letter, Mr. Wriford
stepped in here and took for to-morrow two first-class
tickets to London: a fast train at five o'clock in the
afternoon, he was told.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
The morrow brought Mr. Bickers at midday, Mrs. Bickers
and Mr. Wriford and Essie at the station to
meet him, Essie in his arms and hugging him with
delighted cries of joy before he is well out of the train.
It is a thing to make all who stand about on the
platform desist from their own greetings to see her slim
young figure in its pretty white dress flash forward as
the train comes in, and to smile at her cry of "There he
is!  Oh, jus' look at his summer waistcoat he's got!"
and then to see her in his arms with "Oh, Dad!  Oh,
if you don't look a darling in that waistcoat!
Whereever did you get it, though?"
</p>

<p>
Most wonderfully animated she is, most radiantly
pretty.  Mr. Bickers, after affectionate greeting of his
wife, and to Mr. Wriford most genial "Hullo, Arthur!
All right?  That's the way!  Glad to see you again,
Arthur," watches her adoringly where she has returned
to his carriage with "I'll get your bag, Dad!" and says:
"Doesn't she look a picture, our Essie!  Doesn't
Whitecliffe suit our Essie!"
</p>

<p>
Most wonderfully animated she is, most radiantly
pretty&mdash;chattering; walking with gay little skips as
she holds Dad's hand while they proceed to the lodgings;
carrying them all with her a dozen times on her
irresistible appeal of: "Oh, isn't that funny, though!  Let's
have a laugh," before the lodgings are reached.
</p>

<p>
It is much more than Whitecliffe's breezes that make
her thus, much more than joy at Dad's arrival: it is
that this is To-day, the promised day&mdash;the secret
come to bursting-point, and to burst out in all its
wonder at any moment that Mr. Wriford may choose to
relieve the almost unbearable excitement and mystery
and tell her it may be told.  "Feels to me like all the
birthdays I ever had all rolled into one," Essie had
declared to Mr. Wriford early that morning.  "If you'd
seen me jump out of bed when I woke up!  Oh, jus'
think when we tell them!  Will it be when Dad arrives
at the station?  Well, at lunch, then?"  And when
Mr. Wriford smiles and shakes his head at each of these,
"Well, but they think you're going to-day!  Oh, if ever
I knew any one love a mystery like you do!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you when," says Mr. Wriford.  "I'll tell
you all of a sudden."  For him also it is the day&mdash;the
promised day&mdash;awaited thus with deliberate purpose,
and he a little nervous, a little restless, something ill
at ease now that its hour swiftly comes.
</p>

<p>
"You're never going to keep it till the very last
minute just before they think you're going?  My goodness,
I couldn't bear it.  I'll simply scream.  I know I
shall."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Essie, I'll tell you.  I'm going by the
five o'clock train to London&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Essie corrects him.  "You mean that's what you'll
say you are.  Oh, how ever I won't scream I can't
think!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, just before that we'll say we're going for a
last walk together&mdash;for me to say good-bye to
everything; and then we'll arrange how to&mdash;tell them."
</p>

<p>
She clapped her hands and laughed with glee.  "If
you're not a caution, Arthur!  Oh, how ever I won't
scream before five o'clock!  Oh, when we tell them!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At five o'clock she was to be lying still, with silent
lips: he on his knees: death waiting.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />THE BUSINESS
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
"You're never going to keep it till the very last
minute?" Essie had said.  Mr. Wriford's plan rested
for its actual execution upon this very fact of keeping
it till the very last minute&mdash;from her.  Essie had
thrilled with the delicious mystification of "They think
you're going to-day."  It was his carefully deliberated
project suddenly to spring upon her that indeed he was
going to-day&mdash;and then to ask her: "I'm going, Essie&mdash;by
this train&mdash;I'm not going back to say good-bye&mdash;I'm
going now&mdash;for ever.  Essie, are you coming with
me?"
</p>

<p>
Thus was she suddenly to be presented with it.  Thus
was she to decide&mdash;flatly, immediately.  She was to
know what sort of union he intended.  She was either
to fear it and let him go from her&mdash;as he would go&mdash;at
once and for ever; or of her love for him he was to
carry her with him&mdash;immediately, to have always for
his own!
</p>

<p>
Let Essie decide!  He was holding to that.  With
Essie let the decision be!  All he was doing was to
present the decision to her sharp and clear and sudden:
all he had done was to tell her that he loved her.  But
there resulted to him this: that between the sharpness
of the decision she was to make and the love he had
pressed upon her in these intervening Whitecliffe days,
between the effects of these on such as Essie was, he
was certain of her, convinced of her: so utterly assured
of her that as, after lunch, they left the house for that
last walk in which he was "to say good-bye to
everything," he told Mr. and Mrs. Bickers: "Don't be
anxious if we're not back by half-past four.  There's
another train at seven.  I can just as well go by that if
we find we want to stop out a bit;" so certain of her
that, as they left the house, "Bring a warm wrap of
some kind," he said to Essie.  "Bring that long cloak
of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it's as hot as anything!" Essie protested.
But the agonies of "nearly screaming" in which she
had sat through lunch while Mother and Dad said how
sorry they were Arthur was going, and that if the job
of work he was after fell through he was to be sure and
let them know at once&mdash;the agonies of enduring this
without screaming, made it, as she told him when they
were started, impossible "to stand there arguing on the
steps with them watching us, so I've got to lug this
along, and don't I look half a silly carrying it either,
all along the parade too!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry it," said Mr. Wriford and took the cloak;
"and we won't keep along the parade.  We'll go that
walk of ours in towards Yexley Green and round by
that white house with the jolly garden and come out on
to the cliff.  That'll give us plenty of time to get back."
</p>

<p>
Essie laughed and skipped.  "Plenty of time!  How
you can keep it up like that I can't think.  My goodness,
if you oughtn't to be on the stage!  Hope you like
carrying that cloak!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, there'll be a shower or two, I shouldn't be
surprised," said Mr. Wriford.  "Anyway, it'll do to
sit down on when we get over to the cliff and sit
down&mdash;to arrange."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
This white house with the jolly garden that was to
be the turning-point of their walk had come to be quite
a place of pilgrimage since its chance discovery on the
first morning of the holiday.  "Whitehouse" was its
name.  It was tenantless.  An auctioneer's placard
announced that it was for sale.  They had walked far
along the cliffs from Whitecliffe Sands on that first
morning, had taken a winding lane that led to Yexley
Green, and in the lane suddenly had come upon Whitehouse,
with which immediately Essie, and Mr. Wriford
scarcely less, had fallen most encaptivatingly in love.
A high wall surrounded it.  They had explored its
garden: kitchen garden with fruit trees; and a bit of lawn
with a shady old elm; and enticing odd little bits of
garden tucked here and there behind shrubberies and
in corners; and a little stable&mdash;at the stable Mr. Wriford
had said: "That's where you'd keep a fat little
pony, Essie, and have one of those jolly little governess
cars and drive into Whitecliffe every day to do the
shopping."  And "Oh, if ever!" Essie had cried delightedly;
and immediately and thenceforward the thing had been
to come here every day and imagine Whitehouse was
theirs and plan the garden&mdash;sadly neglected&mdash;as
they would have it if it were.  One storey high, the
house, and white, and "sort of bulging, the darling,"
as Essie had said, with the effect that the three
ground-floor rooms and even the kitchen at the back were
spaciously circular in shape.  High French windows&mdash;"My
goodness, though, if there aren't more windows
than walls almost!"  Encircled all about by a wide,
paved verandah.
</p>

<p>
"It's the very house for an author," Mr. Wriford
had declared.  "Shut away from everything by that
jolly old wall, Essie; and this room&mdash;come and look
at this room, Essie&mdash;this would be mine where I'd
write.  It must get the sun pretty well all day, and it's
sort of away from the others&mdash;quite quiet.  Couldn't
I write in there!"
</p>

<p>
Essie with her nose flat against the window: "Oh,
wouldn't it be glorious!  Can't I just see you sitting
in there writing a book!  Perhaps I'd be out on the
verandah here with a little dog that I'd have and just
have a peep at you sometimes!"
</p>

<p>
To-day as they came by Whitehouse and turned
towards the cliffs there was a sudden development of
these imaginative ecstasies.  The showers that
Mr. Wriford had foreboded, heralded by watery clouds
trailing up from the west, approached in quickening
drops of heavy rain as they came through Yexley Green.
They were at Whitehouse when sudden midsummer
downpour broke and descended.
</p>

<p>
"My goodness!" cried Essie.
</p>

<p>
"We'll shelter in the porch&mdash;in the verandah,"
said Mr. Wriford and opened the gate.  "Run, Essie!"
</p>

<p>
In the porch, Essie breathless and laughing from
their helter-skelter rush, and shaking the raindrops
from her skirts, Mr. Wriford read again a duplicate of
the auctioneer's notice posted at the gate.  He came
to the last words and read them aloud with exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"'Open to view!'  Essie, if we haven't been donkeys
all this time!  I believe it's&mdash;"  He turned the handle
of the door.  "It is.  It's open!"
</p>

<p>
"Oo-oo!" cried Essie, clasping her hands in delight,
flashing her sparkling eyes all about the wide hall&mdash;its
white panelling, its inglenook fireplace, its room-doors
standing ajar with captivating peeps of interiors
even more entrancing than when seen from outside,
its low, spacious stairway bending up to the first
floor&mdash;"Oh, if ever!  Oh, Arthur, if it isn't a darling!"
</p>

<p>
At the cliffs&mdash;and they had been within five minutes
of them when the rain came&mdash;he had planned they
should sit down and he would tell her: "I'm going by
the five o'clock train.  Here's my ticket.  Essie, are
you coming with me?  Look, here's yours."  The
diversion of being within enchanting Whitehouse, his
laughter at Essie's ecstasies as from room to room they went,
momentarily forgot him his purpose&mdash;and yet, and
partly of envisaging within these perfect surroundings
the very joy, settled with Essie in dwelling-place so
conducive to work and happiness as this, that soon
should be his, brought him (and her) directly to it.
</p>

<p>
With light and trifling steps they suddenly were
plunged amidst it.  The exploration, twice repeated,
was done.  Essie was in ecstasies anew over the sitting-room,
of which Mr. Wriford told her again: "Yes, this
would be yours.  That's the dining-room behind, you
see, with a door to the kitchen where your servants
would be."
</p>

<p>
"Not really two servants?" said Essie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rather&mdash;three perhaps; and then the gardener
chap who'd look after your pony-trap."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my goodness!" said Essie, sparkling.  "Do
just go on, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well, this would be yours.  We wouldn't call
it the drawing-room or any rot like that.  Just your
room with jolly furniture and a little bureau where
you'd keep your accounts.  We'd have tea in here when
we didn't have it outside.  The servants would call it
the sitting-room.  We'd call it jolly little Essie's room.
I'd get fed up with working sometimes, you know, and
come and sprawl about in here.  You'd be sewing or
something, I expect."
</p>

<p>
Essie had no expression for all this but an enormous
sigh of ecstasy.  Then she said: "Now we'll go back
to yours," and hand in hand they came to it&mdash;and to
their reckoning.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
"Simply built for a chap to write in," Mr. Wriford
said.  "Just look how it gets the sun.  It's stopped
raining.  I'd come here directly after breakfast.  That's
the time I can write.  There's where I'd have my table.
You'd see I was kept quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wouldn't I just," said Essie.  "You see, there's
a passage comes right down to this door, and my goodness
if I saw any of the servants come past that corner
there, or even go into the room overhead!  My goodness,
they'd know it if they did!"
</p>

<p>
He put his arm about her shoulders and laughed and
pressed her to him; and Essie said: "Oh, just fancy if
it really could be ours!"
</p>

<p>
He kept her there.  She in his arm, they in surroundings
such as these: he working, she ministering to him&mdash;ah,
return to life! return to life!
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll have a place as like it as we can find,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  With just a little sigh, "We
never could," she said.  "We'll be happier than
anything wherever we are; but one thing, there couldn't
be another darling place like this, and another, it would
cost a fair fortune.  Why, it's not even to let.  It's only
for sale."
</p>

<p>
He told her easily: "That's all right.  That's just
what we're going to do&mdash;buy a little place somewhere.
I bet a thousand would buy this Whitehouse, buried
away down here."
</p>

<p>
Essie made a tremendous mouthful of the word:
"Well, a <i>thousand</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed and squeezed her in reproof again.  "Or
two," he said.  "Won't you ever understand what they
pay for what you call the silly books?"
</p>

<p>
She had protested before, when in these Whitecliffe
days he had assured her of his identity with Philip
Wriford, that she never would have said silly in the
library that evening if she had known the book was his
"really."  She protested now again with a wriggle and
a laugh; but quickly upon her protest looked up at him
with: "Oh, you can't ever mean that you really could
buy this?  You simply can't?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, "why not then?  Why not?  Oh,
Arthur, just think if you would!  Oh, jus' think!"
</p>

<p>
The smile went from his lips and from his eyes.
Whitehouse, so near to Mother and Dad, was impossible.
Flight must take them, and keep them, very far from
here.  Before he could speak it was this very fact of
proximity to home that she adduced in further persuasion.
</p>

<p>
"And think," she cried, "how near we'd be to Mother
and Dad!  Jus' an hour in the train.  I could see them
every week.  I expect you've thought they'd live with
us, you being so rich.  But they never would, you know.
Dad would never leave his shop, one thing; and another,
Mother's often said when we've talked about me getting
married one day, that a girl ought to have a home of
her own and not have her mother tied round her neck.
Why, this would be perfect, this darling Whitehouse,
and so close to them!  Oh, if you really can, Arthur!"
</p>

<p>
Here was the telling of it.
</p>

<p>
"I can't," he said.  "We can't live here, Essie."
</p>

<p>
She detected something amiss in his tone.  There
went out of her face the fond and smiling entreaty
expressive of her plea.  She said: "Arthur, why?"
</p>

<p>
To one of the windows there was a broad window-seat,
and he took her to it.  "Let's sit down here,
Essie."
</p>

<p>
She said: "Oh, whatever is it, dear?"
</p>

<p>
He took her hand.  "It's this.  What I told your
father and mother about going by the five o'clock train
is true.  I am going.  It's nearly four now.  It's time
to be starting back.  I am going.  Look, here's my
ticket."
</p>

<p>
Wonderingly she looked at it, and at him.  "Oh,
you can't be?"
</p>

<p>
"I am.  There's the ticket.  Essie, look.  Here's
yours."
</p>

<p>
She almost laughed.  She looked at his face and the
impulse was checked.  But she said half-laughingly,
her brows prettily puckered: "Oh, whatever?  Is it
a game, dear, you're having?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it's no game.  It's very serious.  I'm going&mdash;for
good.  Not coming back&mdash;ever."
</p>

<p>
She made a little distressful motion with her hands.
"Oh, Arthur, don't go on so, dear.  Whatever can you
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean just what I say.  I'm going&mdash;at five
o'clock."  He stopped and looked intently into her
wondering, her something shadowed, eyes.  He said:
"Essie, are you coming with me?"
</p>

<p>
This time she laughed.  It obviously was a game!
A little ring of her clear and merry laughter, and her
eyes that always sparkled, that had been shadowed,
sparkling anew.  "Oh, if you oughtn't to be an actor
on the stage!  If you didn't half frighten me, though!"
and she laughed again.  "Why, how could I come?
Why, we're not married yet!"
</p>

<p>
Now!
</p>

<p>
He put an arm about her and drew her to him.
"Don't let me frighten you, Essie.  Trust me.  Trust
me.  Come with me, Essie.  I'll take care of you.  I'll
love you always.  You'll never regret it&mdash;not a
moment.  You know what I can do for you&mdash;everything
you want.  You know how happy we'll be&mdash;happy,
happy."
</p>

<p>
He had imagined&mdash;he had prepared for&mdash;everything
that she might say: fears, tears, doubts, protests&mdash;he
had rehearsed his part, his fond endearments,
his dear cajoleries, against them all.  He was utterly
unprepared for her answer, for the gentle puzzlement
in her eyes that went with it, for the Sunday-school
awe in her voice with which she spoke it.
</p>

<p>
"What, live in sin?" said Essie.
</p>

<p>
He was prepared for, he had rehearsed, every way
this telling of her might go.  Across any difficulties of
it he had stepped to the utter conviction of her that,
howsoever it went, would radiantly end it, he knew.
He was utterly unprepared for this her first contribution
to it, for each and all with which she followed it,
for the sudden fear, and then the quickly mounting
fear, and then the knowledge, that she was lost to
him&mdash;that the game was up, the thing done, the plans
shattered, the future irrevocably destroyed: he was most
unprepared of all, as the knowledge came and grew and
burned within him, for the fury that began to fill him
at his loss, the fury and the hate that finally he broke
upon her.  And God, God, how vilely quickly the thing
was projected, was fought, was done!  In one minute,
as it seemed to him, they were lovingly trifling their
plans of Whitehouse; in the next, those very plans had
swept him to the telling; in the next, return to life was
crushed like ashes in his mouth, and his fury and hate
were out and raging; in the next, they were back returning
on the cliffs, a blustering wind got up, rain again
streaming.
</p>

<p>
Look how it went.  Consider the quickness of it.
</p>

<p>
"What, live in sin?"
</p>

<p>
He caught her to him.  "Live together, live together,
Essie&mdash;always.  Don't talk about sin."
</p>

<p>
"How could I?  Oh, how ever could I?"
</p>

<p>
"Together, together, Essie!  Think of us together
in a little house of our own just like this.  Think of you
looking after me, and of me looking after my sweet,
my dear, my darling!"
</p>

<p>
"How could I, dear?  How could I?"
</p>

<p>
"Trust me&mdash;trust me!  Ah, those tears in my darling's
darling eyes!  Look how I kiss them away and
hold her in my arms and always hold her."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't, dear.  I couldn't."
</p>

<p>
"You know I'm different.  You know how different
I am from other men.  That's why I ask you, why I
take you, without marrying you.  Does it frighten you
at first?  Only at first.  You know I'm different.  You
know you trust me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you don't love me!  You don't love me, after all!"
</p>

<p>
Chill at his heart.
</p>

<p>
"I can't live without you, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you couldn't ask me to live in sin, not if you
loved me."
</p>

<p>
Swift fear that he has lost her.
</p>

<p>
"It is because I love you.  Because I love you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, didn't I love to think you loved me, Arthur!
You don't.  You don't."
</p>

<p>
Losing her!  The knowledge loses him the ardour of
his words, halts him and stumbles him among them.
"You're silly, you're silly to talk like that!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, didn't I think you loved me truly!"
</p>

<p>
Lost her!  He knows it.  He feels it.  There is something
in her simple, plaintive exclamations, in her "I
couldn't, couldn't, dear," in her abandonment to belief
that he cannot love her&mdash;there is some damned, numbing
essence in it that emanates as it were from her spirit
and thus informs him; and thus informing him, numbs
and dumbs his own.  Lost her!  And cannot combat
it.  Lost her!  And has no words, no help.  Fury beginning
in him.  Fury at his impotence mounting within
him.  Return to life!  By God, by God, to lose it!
</p>

<p>
"Essie, will you let me go, then?  Now?  For ever?
You can't.  All our love?  All our happiness we're going
to have?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, didn't I think you loved me truly!"
</p>

<p>
Fury within him.  That maddening iteration of her
maddening cry!  He can scarcely retain his fury.  He
chokes it back.  He is hoarse as he grinds out words.
"Think of us in a little house like we've planned."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't, dear, I couldn't!"
</p>

<p>
"Think how we'll have everything we want!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can't bear to hear you tempting me!"
</p>

<p>
Fury in a storm breaks out of him.  "Oh!" he cries
and makes a savage action with his arms that thrusts
her from him.  "Oh, for God Almighty's sake, don't
drag the Bible into it!"
</p>

<p>
She says: "Arthur!"
</p>

<p>
He gets violently to his feet, his hands clenched, and
makes again that savage, breaking action of his arms,
and cries at her: "Temptation and sin and rubbish,
rubbish, like that!  Let it alone!  If you don't love me,
say so!  If you're going to let me go, say so!  Don't
drag the Bible into it!  If you don't love me, say so, say
so, say so!"
</p>

<p>
"Arthur, you know I love you.  You don't love me,
dear!"
</p>

<p>
A last effort.  A last control of his fury.  He turns to
her.  "Essie, I can't live without you.  Essie!  Essie!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you couldn't love me to ask me to live in sin!"
</p>

<p>
That ends it.  That expression&mdash;its beastly and
vulgar piety, its common, vulgar phraseology&mdash;sweeps
across his fury as in a rasping shudder of abhorrence.
He breaks his fury out upon it.  He bursts out: "By
God, you're common, common!  Do you think I'd
marry you&mdash;you?  What do you think you are?  Who
do you think I am?  Marry you!  Marry you!  Let's
get out of this!  Let's go home, and you can tell your
father and your mother!"
</p>

<p>
Return to life!  Gone, gone!  Lost, lost!  He was
shaking with hate and shaking with utter fury.  He
walked to the door and staggered as he walked and must
stop and correct his direction as though he were drunken.
At the door he turned to her and saw that she remained
seated, leaning back against the window, her hands
clasped.  He cried: "Are you coming?  Are you coming?"
</p>

<p>
She got up and came to him and went through the
doorway before him and through the outer door.  He
slammed it behind him, and they passed out from Whitehouse
and up the lane, and out upon the cliffs and turned
along them homeward.  Raining.  He carried her cloak
but did not offer it her.  A wind blew gustily from off
the land that frequently buffetted him, and her, and at
whose buffettings and at the slippery foothold of the
rain-swept grass he angrily exclaimed.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
IV
</h4>

<p>
She walked to seaward of him close along the cliff's
edge.  Here the cliff fell sharply a few feet, then
overhung an outward lap of gorse and bracken, sheer then
to the sands.  Once as they pressed and slipped their
way along, he caught her eyes.  She was crying.  He
sneered: "You can tell your father and mother!"
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath to answer him: "As if&mdash;I
should!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you crying about, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I think you loved me&mdash;truly!"
</p>

<p>
They were approaching the little coastguard station
of Yexley Gap.  Damn this rain.  Damn this slippery
grass.  Damn this infernal wind.  A fiercer gust came
blustering seaward.  He caught with both hands at his
hat&mdash;nearly gone.  Essie's cloak upon his arm blew
across his eyes&mdash;blinded him, and he had to stop.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She didn't scream.  It was not a cry.  She just, in
perplexity, in puzzlement, in trouble as it were, said
"<i>Arthur!</i>"
</p>

<p>
She was balancing.  She was struck by the wind and
balancing&mdash;balancing with her body and with her arms,
and looking at him as if she did not quite know what
was happening to her; and in the like perplexity said
to him "<i>Arthur!</i>"&mdash;balancing, over-balancing.
</p>

<p>
There were not ten feet between them.  He rushed,
and slipped as he rushed.  It was like running with
those leaden feet of nightmare.  It seemed to him an
immense time before he reached her.  A horrible,
blundering, unspeakable business, then.  The cloak, the
accursed cloak, got between them&mdash;between them.  A
jumbling, ghastly, blundering business, their hands
fumbling on either side of it.  Was this going on for
ever and ever?  The accursed cloak fumbled itself away.
Ah, God, now it was their naked hands that were
fumbling&mdash;all wet and slippery with rain, seeming to
be all fists and no fingers and only knocking against
one another instead of catching hold.  And not a word
said, and only very quick breathing, and jumbling and
fumbling and jumbling.  Look here, this fumbling, she's
falling, toppling; is this going on for ever and ever and
ever?
</p>

<p>
It was her hands that in the last wild, hideous
fumbling clutched his.  She toppled right back.  He fell.
He was face downwards upon the slippery grass, to his
waist almost over the cliff, and slipping, slipping, and
she had his hands&mdash;the backs of his hands over the
knuckles so that his fingers were imprisoned and useless,
and there she hung and dragged him, and he was slipping.
</p>

<p>
He said: "O God, Essie!  O God!  Can't you get
your hands higher up, so I can hold you, instead of you
holding me?"
</p>

<p>
She said: "I shall fall if I do."
</p>

<p>
He said: "My darling!  My darling!  Hold on, then,
Essie.  Dig your nails in."
</p>

<p>
"Am I hurting you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, for God's sake, Essie, hold, hold!"
</p>

<p>
Next she said: "Are you slipping?"
</p>

<p>
He said: "Some one will come.  Some one will come.
I heard a shout.  Hold!  Hold!"
</p>

<p>
She persisted: "Are you slipping?"
</p>

<p>
He said: "Yes.  I'm slipping.  Hold!  Hold!"
</p>

<p>
There isn't any need to describe anything&mdash;of his
gradual slipping by her drag upon him, of his useless
hands enviced in hers, of her very terrible clutch upon
them.
</p>

<p>
She presently said: "Tell me that what you said on
the seat that night, dear."
</p>

<p>
He knew.  He cried most passionately: "I love you, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Truly?"
</p>

<p>
From the uttermost depths of his heart: "Truly!  Truly!"
</p>

<p>
"More than any one?"
</p>

<p>
From his soul, from all his deepest depths, from all
he ever had suffered, from all he ever had been, "Essie,"
he cried, "before God I love you more than all the
world!"
</p>

<p>
She said: "You can't raise me to kiss me, can you,
dear?"
</p>

<p>
He said: "I can't, Essie."
</p>

<p>
"Are you slipping?"
</p>

<p>
He did not answer her.  He was slipped almost
beyond recovery.
</p>

<p>
She then said: "Say that again&mdash;'before God.'
I like that, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Essie, Essie, before God I love you above all the
world!"
</p>

<p>
She gave a little sigh.  She said: "Well, both of
us&mdash;what's the sense to it, dear?" and she opened her
fingers, and he saw her whizz, strike the face of the cliff
where it jutted out, and pitch, and crash among the
gorse and bracken, and roll over and over to the very
edge of the outward lap above the sands, and caught
there and lying there ... her jolly little dress for
Whitecliffe lying there.
</p>

<p>
A hand grabbed him, or he, beyond recovery of his
balance, had followed her.  A coastguard grabbed him
and dragged him back.  He said in a thick, odd voice:
"What the devil's the use of that now?  You fool, what
the devil's the use of that?"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He lay there, the rain stopped, in the sunshine.  He
just lay there&mdash;a minute, an hour, a year, a lifetime,
eternity?  They went down&mdash;a circuitous path to
where she lay.  They brought her up.  They carried
her, on a shutter, past him.  He gave some wordless
sound from his lips and scrambled on his knees towards
their burden and threw his arms about it and clung
there, with wordless sounds.
</p>

<p>
One man said: "She's alive, sir."
</p>

<p>
Another man said: "We'd best try to get her home
before&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A third man said: "Can you walk to show us the way?"
</p>

<p>
He got up and went stumbling along.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
THE SEEING
</h3>

<p>
They carry her to her room.  There is only one doctor
in Whitecliffe.  He is found and fetched; and leaving
Mr. and Mrs. Bickers by the bedside, comes down to
the sitting-room where is a man stunned to apparent
speechlessness by grief, whom he takes to be the
patient's brother.  The doctor says he will stay till the
end, and for "the end" then substitutes "for the night."  There
is nothing he can do immediately and by himself.
He speaks of the possibility of an operation in the
morning, but seemingly has no thought of telegraphing to a
surgeon he names who could perform it.  She will pass
away without recovery of consciousness, he fears.
There is not only the injury to her head but of her spine.
More than that there is the question of&mdash;  If the case
had been taken to the hospital at Market Redding....
The man whom he takes to be her brother drags with
blundering fingers from his pocket a packet of
banknotes and thrusts them towards him with a curious
action&mdash;an action suggestive (were not the idea
ridiculous) of their being some horrible thing.
</p>

<p>
Well, are they not the price of her that was to buy
her?
</p>

<p>
Taking the packet, the doctor flushes.  He had judged
these people by the rooms they occupy&mdash;a clumsy
thing to do at the seaside where frequently people must
take what accommodation they can find.  This man's
educated bearing, perceptible despite the grief that
scarcely enables him to speak, should have informed
him of his mistake.  Very well, he will telegraph.  He
cannot hold out much hope.  But convey hope to those
poor old folk up-stairs.  Indeed, of course one knows
of cases....  In these days of aeroplanes one hears
of cases where terrible falls, long periods of unconsciousness,
have been survived.  Eh?  Still&mdash;and though he is
alone in the sitting-room with this the poor girl's brother
he drops his voice and tells him....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She lies in her room, Mother and Dad with her.  She
lies there unconscious and only, under God, to wake
to die.  He that had stumbled before her bier, directing
those who bore her, stumbles now from the house.  "Kill
me!  Kill me!"  Ah, cry that pulses as a wound within
him; that he desires to cry aloud, and would cry aloud,
and does wordlessly groan with his breathing.  But
there is agony that he endures that of speech bereaves
him, of power of movement wherewith to carry out
what now alone remains, numbs and denies him.  There
is a seat without the house upon the parade.  He drops
upon it, and there endures ... and there endures....
</p>

<p>
Endures!  It is as if there had been discovered to him
within him some vital core, some spot, some nucleus
of life, some living soul and centre of him, capable of
receiving the very quick and apotheosis of torture, such
as all his normal body and all his normal mind delivered
over to rack and irons could not have felt.  There is a
point in human pain where pain, numbing the centres
of the mind, mercifully defeats itself and can no more.
There is discovered to him within him a core, a quick,
an essence of him, capable of agony to infinity, down
into which, as a blunted knife, drives every thought
in writhing agony.  In physical agony he writhes
beneath them, twisting his legs, driving his nails within
his palms, bleeding with his teeth his lips.
</p>

<p>
In that flash while she fell, and falling saved him:
"She has given her life for mine!"  In that hour, that
age, that all eternity of time while, prone and powerless,
rescued upon the cliff he lay: "Twice, twice, I look
upon a body lifeless to let mine live!"  In that
stumbling progression before her bier: "Kill me!  Kill me!
O vile, O worst, O foulest, unnameable thing, betake
thyself to hell, if any hell be vile enough to hold thee!"
</p>

<p>
Revelation!  Revelation!  As she fell, as he lay, as
he stumbled, as here he writhes in agony&mdash;revelation&mdash;and
all his life in terrible review beneath it.  "Kill
me!  Kill me!" he groans.  "O vile, O worst, O foulest,
unnameable thing, betake thyself to hell, if any hell be
vile enough to hold thee!"
</p>

<p>
"Not so.  Not yet," there answers him.  It is as
though there speak to him his thoughts with voice that
peals imperatively through all his being, reverberating
through him in tremendous majesty of doom, as through
the aisles reverberates and makes to tremble all the air
an organ's swelling thunder.
</p>

<p>
"Not so!  Not yet!  Thou hast not strength to move
to find thy hell.  Rise if thou canst.  Stay, for thou
must.  Revelation is here.  Behold thy life beneath it!"
</p>

<p>
He crouches there.  Enormously it thunders all about
him.  "Revelation!  O blind, O purblind miserable!
Have not a thousand lights been thrust before thee to
proclaim thee this that only now thou seest?  Thou
seeker after happiness!  Thou greatly-to-be-pitied!
Thou sufferer!  Thou victim of affliction!  Thou
innocent!  Thou greatly wronged!  Is it thus thou hast seen
thyself?  Ah, whining wretch that thou hast been!  Ah,
blind, ah, purblind fool, that could not see!  That first
must have a life to show thee!  That first must send
to death he that in daily sacrifices of thy companionship
had shown thee happiness was sacrifice!  Blind,
blind!  Thou must demand death of him to try to rend
thy blindness, and still wast blind, still cried to heaven
of thy misery, still wast of all men most to be pitied,
most oppressed!  Ah, whining wretch!  To her for more
revelation thou must come.  By her, daily, hourly
revelation is thrust before thee&mdash;she, that gay, that sweet,
that joyous life, whose every single, smallest thought
was thought for others, and still, O soul enmired,
enmeshed in blindness, thou couldst not see!&mdash;still thou
must have the deeper sacrifice!  One life doth not
suffice thee.  Another thou must have.  And now thou
criest: 'Revelation!  Revelation!'  What cost?  Look,
look, thou vilest, now that thine eyes are clear, now
that thy soul is stirred at last from all the slime of self,
self, self, where thou hast kept it&mdash;look now, and
count the cost of this thy revelation.  Look now!  Hold
up thy shuddering soul, new from its slime, to look how
all thy life is strewed with sacrifices made for thee, how
at each step, blind, thou hast demanded more; how
two whose every slightest breath was more of beauty
than all thy years have made, how two were given thee;
how in thy blindness thou rebukedst them both in each
devotion, in every act of love, of care, and must press
on to have their lives, their broken bodies&mdash;he by the
sea, she by the cliff&mdash;for this thy revelation."
</p>

<p>
Day comes to evening, evening reaches into night.
"Kill me!  Kill me!" he moans.  "O vile, O worst,
O foulest thing, O blind, let me betake myself to hell,
if any hell be vile enough to hold me!"
</p>

<p>
There answers him in dreadful summons, in final roll
and crash of sound: "Look back.  Look back.  Thou
hast purchased this thy revelation.  Thou hast recovered
from its slime thy soul.  Two lives and boundless
love thou hast demanded for it.  Thy price is paid.
Look back, look back.  Hold up that soul of thine and
see the way that thou hast come.  Then seek thy hell,
if hell will have thee.  Hold up thy soul!"
</p>

<p>
The sound is snatched away.  Only its resonance
remains, and sharp and piercing streams the air it
leaves to silence.  In that intensity with new eyes he
looks back; and now into this quick, this nucleus of
life within him that is made capable of pain transcending
human pain, receives each vision that his new eyes
reveal.  In agony receives them, writhing at their
torture.  Who had been happy?  They that had sacrificed!
Happy till when?  Till he came!  Happy in what?  In
selflessness, in selflessness....  Who had been happy?
That uncouth vagabond that in their every moment
together had tended him, cared for him, protected him.
O blind, that, mired in self, never till now had realised
his strong devotion!  In shame, in horror, in grief's
abandonment, he cries aloud his uncouth name: "Puddlebox!
Puddlebox!  For me!  O God, for me!"  Writhing,
he hears his jolly voice: "O ye tired strangers
of the Lord: bless ye the Lord."  Hears his jolly voice:
"Down, loony, down!" ... That was on the wagon,
receiving blows that he might escape! ... Hears his
jolly voice: "You think too much about yourself, boy,
and therefore I name you spooked." ... O blind, O
blind that all his life had thought too much about
himself, and only of himself&mdash;thought only of how to win
his own happiness, realised never till now that
happiness was in making others happy, and nowhere else,
and nowhere else! ... Hears his jolly voice: "Wherefore
whatsoever comes against me, boy&mdash;heat, cold;
storm, shine; hunger, fullness; pain, joy&mdash;cause for
praise I find in them all and therefore sing: 'O ye
world of the Lord; bless ye the Lord.'" ... O blind,
blind, that many weeks lived with that creed and never
till now realised its meaning....  Hears his jolly voice:
"I like you, boy." ... Hears his jolly voice: "Why,
what to the devil is the sense of it, boy?"&mdash;but doing
it, following it, for him! ... O blind, O blind! ... Hears
his jolly voice: "I'm to you now, boy!  I'm to
you, boy.  Why, that's my loony!" ... Hears his
jolly voice: "Wedge in, boy!  Wedge in!  Swim!  Why,
I'd swim that rotten far with my hands tied, and I
challenge you or any man&mdash;" ... Sees him swing off his
hands, and drop, and go, and drown, and die....  O
blind, blind, blind!
</p>

<p>
Deep swings the night about him; deep sounds the
murmuring sea.  "Kill me!  Kill me!" he groans.
"O vile, O worst, O foulest thing, let me betake myself
to hell, if any hell be vile enough to hold me!"
</p>

<p>
There answers him: "Not so.  Not yet.  Look back.
Look back.  Hold up thy soul, new from its slime of
self, self, self, and look along the way that thou hast
come.  Hold up thy soul and look!"
</p>

<p>
He is searching, he is searching in the days at Pendra.
He is wondering, he is wondering.  Is there some secret
of happiness in life that he has missed?  O blind, O
purblind in the face of God!  Day and night, by
countless love, by endless devotion, the secret had been
thrust before him.  Blind!  Of self alone he had thought.
The last, the uttermost sacrifice had been presented
him.  Blind!  Enmired, enmeshed in self, it had shown
him nothing, left him still whimpering, still wondering,
still seeking, still pitying his fate.  Who had been happy?
Essie!  Essie!  Happy till when?  Till he came!  Happy
in what?  In selflessness!  Blind!  O blindness black
beyond belief, now that with new eyes he sees it.
Puddlebox had shown him.  Essie not alone had shown
him but had told him.  On that day of the depth of his
misery at the Tower House School, when she had helped
and advised him by telling of her way with her own
Sunday-school boys: "You jus' try it," she had said.
"I mean to say, whatever's the good of anybody if
they don't try to make everybody else happy, is there?
You jus' try."  He had tried.  He had made the boys
happy.  Himself he had touched happiness in theirs.
O blind, O blind!  She had given the very secret of
happiness into his hands, and he had used it and proved
it and yet, so chained in self, had never recognised it,
but had pressed on for further proof.  On past her
"Aren't you quiet, though, sometimes?  I don't mind,
dear."  On past her "Oh, won't I keep you quiet just
when you're working!"  On to her piteous cry: "Oh,
didn't I think you loved me truly!"  On, on, voracious
in his blindness as vampire in its lust, on, on,
demanding yet another life until she says: "Well, both of us,
dear, what's the sense to it?"  Until she lies there,
broken, that he might live.  Until she lies here
unconscious and only, under God, to wake to die.
</p>

<p>
"Kill me!  Kill me!" he groans.  "Let me find hell,
if any hell is vile enough to hold me.  Let me not live
but to create hell here on earth for all who come about
me.  O ye world of the Lord: bless ye the Lord."  He
had crushed out that praise.  "Let's have a laugh!"  He
had crushed out that laughter.
</p>

<p>
Kill himself.  That was left.  That was all.  Ah, if
he had but killed himself when, on that night countless
ages of changed identity ago, he had thrown himself
into the river!  Who had been saved had he not lived?
What of delight had he not robbed the world had he
not trailed across it?  Who had been saved?  Old
Puddlebox&mdash;old Puddlebox had been alive, jovial, genial,
praising.  Essie&mdash;Essie had been alive, laughing,
loving, streaming her sunshine.  Who would have missed
him?  None, none, for there was none in all his life he
had brought happiness.
</p>

<p>
Was there none, indeed?  What is this sudden
apprehension as of some new dismay that checks and holds
him?  What new revelation of his depths has that
question unlocked, unloosed upon him?  What change,
what agony is here?  What bursts within his heart?
What seems to struggle in the air to reach him?  What
sweeps across that quick, that nucleus of life, that core,
that essence, that as deep waters takes his breath and
holds him trembling where till now in torture he has
writhed?
</p>

<p>
"Matey!  Matey!"
</p>

<p>
"Captain!  Captain!"
</p>

<p>
Ah, tumult inexpressible as of bursting floods rushing
in mist and spray from bondage; ah, surging of immensity
of thoughts, of visions.  Missed him had he died?
There was one, there was one had lost a little happiness
had he died when he had tried to die.  "Captain!  Captain!"
</p>

<p>
He hears his voice as he had heard it in the ward:
"Matey!  Matey!  Gor' bless yer, Matey!"
</p>

<p>
He turns about on the seat.  He throws his arms
upon its rail.  He buries his face upon them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There is a step across the road.  A hand touches him.
"Arthur?  Is that you, Arthur?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bickers, bending above him.
</p>

<p>
"Is she dead?"
</p>

<p>
"She's still unconscious.  I'm anxious for Mrs. Bickers,
Arthur.  I want to take her to lie down a little.
Would you just come and watch in case our Essie
wakes?"
</p>

<p>
He gets up and goes with Mr. Bickers to the house.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
PRAYER OF MR. WRIFORD
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Look where she lies.  Never to wake?  Unconscious,
and only, under God, to wake to die?  Surely she but
reposes, smiling, smiling there?  Look where her face,
surrounded by her hair, rests there untouched by
scratch or mark or bruise.  Surely she only sleeps;
and sleeping, surely still pursues those gay young fancies
of her joyous life: look how they seem to smile upon
those soft, expressive lips of hers.  Look where she lies.
Look how her tender form, hid of its suffering, lies there
so slim and shapely beneath the wrappings drawn about
her.  Look at her hands, each slightly closed, that lie
upon her breast: surely to touch them is to feel
responsive their firm, cool clasp? surely to touch them is
to wake her?  Look where she lies.  Never to wake?
Unconscious, and only, under God, to wake to die?
Surely she but reposes, smiling, smiling there?
</p>

<p>
Look where she lies.  This is her room.  Look where
here, and here, and here, and here, are all her little
trinkets, treasures, trifles, she has brought with her
from home for this her jolly holiday.  These are her
portraits here, in those plush frames, of Mother and
of Dad.  That is her text she has illumined, taken from
her "fav'rit:"  "Lift up your heads, O ye gates: and
be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors."  An odd, long text
for framing.  Those are her copper wire "native"
bracelets there.  "Oh, you don't have to look half
smart on the parade, evenings!"  That is her Church-service
by her bed.  He remembers that first night
when he used it.  Those are her best gloves, smoothed
out there.  That old stump of lead pencil lying upon
them was his.  He remembers it.
</p>

<p>
Look where she lies.  On the threshold he pauses.
That is old Mr. Bickers gone again on his knees against
the bed, his white head bowed within his hands.  That
is Mrs. Bickers kneeling there, her lips moving.
Brokenly now, such an odd, deep, trembling sound, comes
Mr. Bickers' voice.  Brokenly&mdash;jumbling his own
words with words familiar.  It is the prayer he had
said was their daily prayer, and he jumbles it with
other prayers and into it jumbles his own.
</p>

<p>
"Lord, now lettest&mdash;"  Mr. Bickers stops; and
there is long silence; and he begins again: "Lord, if
it be thy will, if it be thy will, if it be thy will, if our
Essie's suffering, if it be thy will, Lord, now lettest this
thy servant, thy servant, depart in peace, in peace, in
peace, according to ... mine eyes have seen
thy ... through the tender mercies of our God whereby the
dayspring ... from on high ... hath visited us.
Amen.  Amen."

<p>
Mrs. Bickers says "Amen."  Mrs. Bickers collapses
where she kneels.  Mr. Bickers goes to her and raises
her and says: "There, Mother!  There, Mother, dear!
Come and rest, Mother.  Rest just a little while, Mother.
Arthur's here.  Arthur will stay by her.  Arthur will
tell us.  Just a little while, Mother, dear."
</p>

<p>
She has no resistance.  She is collapsed in his arms.
</p>

<p>
He supports her from the room.  He says to Mr. Wriford:
"I'll just lay her on her bed, Arthur.  Just across
the passage.  Doors open.  I'll hear you.  The doctor's
down-stairs.  There, Mother!  There, there, Mother."
</p>

<p>
Look where she lies.  He is alone with her.
</p>

<p>
Come to this Mr. Wriford on his knees with her, his
hands upon her hand, his head between his outstretched
arms.  Come to his revelation she has revealed to him;
to that which came to him with sudden thought of
Captain; come to his prayer.
</p>

<p>
"This is my dear, my darling, lying here....  I
have looked back.  I have looked back upon such
pitiless review of all my blindness, that to look forward,
to live and not destroy myself, is almost heavier than
I can bear....  I will bear it....  I see.  I
understand.  I accept.  Self has been the cause of all my
wreckage&mdash;thought of myself, always of myself and
of no other.  I see that now&mdash;clearly, bitterly, I see
it.  And yet&mdash;and yet, O God&mdash;in the very moment
of seeing it, I still thought to kill myself.  That was
self again.  I am so rooted in self that, in the very hour
of my revelation, still only of myself I thought&mdash;only
of saving myself by death from these my torments,
only of ending them because I could not bear to let
myself endure them.  All my life I have lived in self.
Ah, with my eyes open&mdash;deeper shame! deeper shame!&mdash;I
almost had died in self.  Ah, even realising that,
still I cannot tear self out of me, still I kneel here
dreading to live, fearing to live, crying that it is heavier than
I can bear, heavier than I can bear!  Oh, what a thing
is self that with such cunning can prevail, how deeply
hidden, in what myriad forms disguised!  Help me to
see it.  Keep my eyes open.  Keep my eyes open....
</p>

<p>
"Well, I accept then.  I will not kill myself....
Lord, since I have accepted, use this my dear, my
darling, no longer for me....  This is my dear, my
darling, lying here beneath thy hand.  She has offered her
life for mine.  Let it suffice, O God.  Judge me apart
from her.  Judge me apart from her.  Judge me apart
from my darling.  One life came to me to open my eyes.
I remained blind.  He gave the deeper sacrifice&mdash;blind
in my blindness I remained.  Then Essie.  Thy
servant.  My jolly little Essie.  If I had killed myself,
if by destroying myself I had mocked her sacrifice,
mocked Thee, O God, then mightest Thou by closing
Thy hand upon her have pursued me even into hell.
But I accept&mdash;but I accept, O God.  Therefore
relieve her&mdash;therefore relieve her&mdash;therefore let suffice
that which she has done....
</p>

<p>
"Am I daring to bargain?  Am I stipulating,
making terms, advancing a price?  Remember, remember
that I am new before Thee, long out of prayer, long
unaccustomed to Thy ways.  It is no bargain, O God.
It is only confusion of these my thoughts.  All that I
ask is this&mdash;judge me apart from her, use her no longer
for me, judge me no more through her, let that which
she has done suffice.  Look, I will go away from her
and leave her.  Whether, beneath Thy wisdom, she
lives or dies shall nothing prevail with me.  If she may
live it shall not strengthen me&mdash;no bargain there, O
God.  If she must die it shall not shake me&mdash;O God,
no bargain there.  Judge me apart from her.  I will
go out of her life.  I will go out from every knowledge
of Thy will towards her.  I will not even pray for her.
I will not even pray for her lest in my heart, beneath
my words, beneath my thoughts, it is in cunning that
actually I am here&mdash;agreeable to forego destruction
of myself if I may know that she is spared; resolved
to kill myself if I be guilty of her death.  Enough&mdash;enough.
Let me end with that while I have clearness
of vision to see it.  This is my dear, my darling, lying
here.  I will go out from all knowledge of her.  Judge
me apart from her.  Let that which she has done suffice."
</p>

<p>
He withdrew his hands from her hand as though in
evidence of detaching himself from her.  He thrust
them out again to touch her and cried "Essie!  Essie!"  He
then took them to his face.
</p>

<p>
He said: "Let me speak as a man.  I will go out
from her.  I will live.  Let me speak as a man.  Let me
not make vain promises, offer false protests.  This is
not religion.  Religion, as it is lived, is nothing to me.
Let me not delude myself nor seek in cunning to delude
Thee.  Let me not try to pretend that this that I have
suffered converts me suddenly from that which I was
to that which Essie is.  Let me speak as a man.  That
is not of a moment.  I am not one man in one moment,
a new man in the next.  I am the same.  All my
infirmities the same&mdash;rooted in me as my bones: bones of
my spirit and no more changed than bones of my body
that are rooted in my flesh.  I am the same.  Ay, even
as I say it, I am tempted to say that I am not the same
but am changed.  Rescue me from that cunning.  Keep
me from that.  Let me not even in cunning pretend,
in self-delusion believe, that this hour, these thoughts,
these torments I have endured will all my life remain
with me.  I have known penitence before.  I have
knelt in presence of death before.  I have wept.  I have
vowed.  Where are my tears?  Where my promises?
Let me speak as a man.  Time swings on.  That which
is all the world to-day is less than dust to-morrow,
That which is laid, beneath death's shadow, in penitence
before Thy feet, is there in ashes, when death has
winged away, to mock Thy mercy.  Time swings on.
Vows made in penitence&mdash;they are no more than to
the drunkard his drink: delusion, forgetfulness,
anodyne, courage until the spirit that has tricked the
brain has gone, until the travail that has worn the soul
has ebbed.  Back then to fear, to baseness, as surely
as night succeeds to day....
</p>

<p>
"What then?  What do I purpose?  What have I
to offer?  Lord, there is only this in me that is different:
that my eyes are opened to that to which all my life
they have been sealed.  I have nothing to promise,
nothing to vow.  I have only to ask: Keep my eyes
open; help me to remember this that my eyes have
seen; help me to know what is self; help me to rid me
of it.  All my life&mdash;all my life from the beginning it
has been self.  Back in the London days when I was
working day and night, when I was longing to be free,
when I thought I was giving up my life to others, it
was all self, self that was destroying me.  It was not
ceaseless work that wrought upon my peace of mind,
robbed me of my youth; it was pitying myself, thinking
of myself, contrasting my lot with that of others.  It
is not work nor trouble that kills a man, robs him of
sleep, loses him his happiness&mdash;it is turning the stress
of it inwards upon himself, never forgetting himself
when occupied with it, always keeping himself before
his eyes, watching himself, pitying himself.  Brida
knew it.  'You think too much about yourself, Phil,'
she used to tell me.  That old Puddlebox had the secret
of it and told it me plainly.  'You think too much
about yourself, boy, and that is what's the matter with
you and with most of us.'  He told it to me plainly.
'I don't believe a word of it,' he told me when he had
heard my story.  'Your story is the same as my story
and the same as everybody else's story in this way:
that you've never done any thing wrong in all your life,
and that all that's happened to you is what other folk
have put upon you.'  Ay, that was it!  I thought I
was sacrificing my life; I was grudging every thought
of it, every moment of it given away from my own
pursuits.  How could I be sacrificing when in doing so I
was unhappy?  That is negation in terms.  To sacrifice
is happiness.  Old Puddlebox showed it me.  This my
Essie showed it me.  To give&mdash;to give time, money,
life itself, and have compassion for oneself in giving
them, that is the very pit of self, worse than self open
and wilful.  That is the selfishness that all my life has
been my curse, my wreckage.  All that ever has happened
to me I have seen in terms of myself and of no
other.  Every trouble, every irritation that in those
London days those poor things about me brought to
me, I at once turned upon myself&mdash;looked at with
my eyes, not with theirs; thought instantly and always,
even while I helped them, how it affected me, not how
it affected them.  Ah, that is the heart of misery and
that is the secret of happiness!  To see only with one's
own eyes, to judge only from one's own point, to
estimate life in terms of self and of no other: that is to
goad oneself on from trial to trial, from misery to
misery.  To see with others' eyes, to judge from their
outlook upon life, to estimate life in terms of those upon
whom life presses and not in terms of self: that is the
secret of happiness, that is the thing in life that I have
missed....
</p>

<p>
"Try me not, O God, in great things.  Help me in
small.  In the small things, in the small, the everyday
things, O God, that is where self comes&mdash;that is where
I shall not see it, that is where, disguised, it will deceive
me.  To quarrel, to complain, to be impatient&mdash;what
is it but self?  Help me to put myself where each one
stands that comes about me.  Help me to look with
their eyes&mdash;how have vexation then?  There is no
vexation, there is no unhappiness in all this world but
what through self a man brings into it.  All happiness,
this world&mdash;in every hour happiness, in every remotest
corner happiness.  But man lives not in it but in his
own world&mdash;the world that he himself creates; of which
he is the centre; that, however little he be, revolves
about him.  That is whence is his unhappiness.  Others
come into his world.  Ah, if he can but watch them in
it with their own eyes, not with his!  God! what a
world this world would be if under Thy hand it were
governed as man governs the world which he himself
creates&mdash;as I have governed mine!  Tolerance for
none but self, pity for none but self, all within it judged,
measured, watched in terms of self!  Rid me of that!
Rid me of self.  Help me to see self.  Help me to see
with others' eyes, not with my own...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So ends his prayer&mdash;so ends his vigil.  Mr. Bickers
returns, and it is towards daybreak.  He looks once
more at her, smiling, smiling there.  He will not even
pray for her.  Let that which she has done suffice.  Let
him be judged apart from her&mdash;not strengthened if
she may live, not shaken if she must die.  He goes down
the stairs; out into young morning spreading across
the sea.

CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
PILGRIMAGE
</h3>

<h4>
I
</h4>

<p>
Not to know&mdash;in no way to be prevailed upon in
this his return to life by knowledge of whether she lives
or has died.  In no way to be strengthened&mdash;but of
himself to live&mdash;if life has been permitted her; in no
way to be shaken if her life has been required.  To be
judged apart from her....
</p>

<p>
Come with this Mr. Wriford while for a year he thus
places in proof his acceptance.  He takes up his life
where on his flight from London he had left it.  To do
that&mdash;not to admit his every impulse which calls upon
him to hide, to live in seclusion, and there dwell with
his memories, cherish his affliction&mdash;is part of his bond
pledged by her bedside.  The secret of happiness has
been purchased for him; let him not mock that which
has been paid.  He has the secret; let him exercise it.
Abandonment to grief&mdash;what is that but pity of self?
Life in retreat, unable to face the world&mdash;what is that
but admission that his fate, that which affects himself,
is harder than he can bear?
</p>

<p>
Bound up in this, he takes train immediately from
Whitecliffe to London, presently is involved in all the
tortures that his welcoming inflicts upon him.  His
return is made a sensation of the hour by his friends and
soon, as he finds, by that larger circle to whom his books
have made him known.  "Where have you been?"  It
is a question to which he seems to have to spend
every hour of all his days in formulating some kind of
answer.  It is a question&mdash;and all the congratulation
and felicitation that goes with it&mdash;that often he tells
himself he can no longer stand and must escape.
"Where have you been?" and all the while it is at
Whitecliffe&mdash;in that room, among those scenes&mdash;that
his heart is, and that he desires only to be left alone
to keep there.  But he does not escape.  But he does
not keep himself alone.  It is self that bids him.  It is
self he has come out to know and face.  He forces himself
to see with the eyes of those that do them the
kindnesses that are done him.  He makes himself respond.
He permits himself no shrinking.
</p>

<p>
He revisits Mr. and Mrs. Filmer.  They have "got
along very well without him," they tell him.
</p>

<p>
"I am bound to say," says Mrs. Filmer, "that at
the time we thought your conduct showed very little
consideration for us.  I am bound to say that."
</p>

<p>
"A mere postcard," says Mr. Filmer, "can relieve
much suspense; but one does not of course always think
of duties to others, h'm, ha."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's just what I am here to think of,"
Mr. Wriford responds.  "Is there anything I can do?
Anything you want?"
</p>

<p>
There is nothing, as it appears, except a manifestation
of fear that he proposes to upset the establishment
by quartering himself upon them, relief from which
expands them somewhat, and they proceed with the
news that two of the boys, his nephews, are on their
way home on leave.
</p>

<p>
The boys come, and in their affairs and in their
interests he finds better response to the "Anything I can
do?" than was received from the Filmers.  Till their
arrival he has had, in seclusion of his rooms, intervals
when he can retreat within his thoughts.  There is a
holiday home to be made for them, and he takes a flat
and occupies himself with them, and these intervals
are denied him.  The young men are here to have a
good time.  There are their eyes for him to see with&mdash;not
his own.  He has a trick, they both notice it, of
saying: "Well, tell me just how you look at the
business."  It is a trick that is expressed also in his manner,
in a certain inviting, sympathetic way that he has, and
it comes to be noticed in the much wider circle of his
friends.  "Used to be a fearfully reserved chap,
Wriford," they say.  "Never quite knew whether he was
shy or thought himself too good for you.  Do you
notice how different he is now?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you ever notice him when he's alone, though&mdash;sitting
in the club here and not knowing you're looking
at him?" another would reply.  "There's a look on
his face then&mdash;he's been through it, Wriford, I'll bet
money."
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
II
</h4>

<p>
Ah, he has been through it and daily feels the mark
of it.  Time swings on.  He settles down.  The
sensation of his return evaporates.  His nephews go back
to their duties.  He settles down.  This is his post&mdash;here
in the hurly-burly.  He will not desert it.  He
takes up his work again.  Long days he sits staring at
the blank sheets of paper before him.  His thoughts are
ready.  There obtrudes between them and the marshalling
of them memories of how it had been planned he
again was to resume them: "Won't I keep you quiet
just, dear!" ... That is self, pity for himself, grieving
for himself.  Let him put it away.  Let him get to
work.  Let it return&mdash;ah, let her face, her voice, her
jolly laughter return to him just for an hour when work
is done, just while he lies awake....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Come to this Mr. Wriford when a year is gone.
Summer again&mdash;June again&mdash;the holidays again&mdash;again
that day.  He has lived through a year of it.  Through
a long year he has proved himself.  If he might know
certainly that she is dead, he could not fall back again.
That is what he has feared at the outset.  He does not
fear it now.  He has lived through a year of it.  He is
assured of himself now.  If he might but make a
pilgrimage to Whitecliffe, see where he had walked with
her, see where perhaps she lies, permit his spirit to walk
those roads, those paths, those fields with her again,
suffer it to stand beside her...!
</p>

<p>
He goes.  He goes first, on a sudden fancy, to far
Port Rannock and stands beside the mound that marks
the grave he knows there.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you old Puddlebox," says Mr. Wriford,
standing there.  "Well, you old Puddlebox.  How goes it?
How goes it now?  Well enough with you, old Puddlebox!
You knew the secret.  I know it now.  Too late
for me, old Puddlebox.  But, if you know, you'll be
shouting your praises on it, eh, old Puddlebox?  What
was it you said as the sea came on to us?  'Well, we've
had some rare times together, boy, since first you came
down the road.'"
</p>

<p>
He suddenly cried: "I would to God&mdash;I would to
God you might shake off this earth, these stones, and
come to me face to face for one moment while I clasped
your hand!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h4>
III
</h4>

<p>
So on to Whitecliffe.  So to his pilgrimage there.
Just such another day awaits him as on that day a year
ago.  Sunshine and clouded sun, as he walks the parade.
Presage of rain, as on through Yexley Green to Whitehouse
he goes.  Whitehouse still stands empty; he walks
the garden, looks through the windows, tries the door,
treads again the rooms where last he had walked with
her.  "Jolly little Essie's room" this was to have been....
This was where he would write....  This was
where wouldn't she keep him quiet just! ... She sat
there while he told her...
</p>

<p>
Up the path to the cliff, along the cliff and past that
place, paused long upon it, and on to Whitecliffe Church.
Here is the churchyard.  He knows all these old
graves&mdash;he had peered here and here and here with Essie,
puzzling their quaint inscriptions.  It is for a new
stone he looks.  Yes, there is one.  Three sides of the
church he walks and only the old stones sees.  Come
to the porch, a new white cross confronts him.  He
goes to it.  It is not hers!  Sense tells him they would
not have brought her here, would not have left her here.
They would have taken her home.  Yes, but that moment
while he crossed the turf towards the cross, that
moment while its letters came in view&mdash;and were not
"Essie,"&mdash;has shaken him so that his limbs tremble, so
that he must somewhere rest ... there is the porch.
</p>

<p>
A troop of noisy boys come through the gate, and
then more boys by ones and twos.  An old man who
comes from within the church and looks out upon the
churchyard for a moment remarks to him first that there
is going to be a shower, then, calling out in reproof at
a pair of the laughing boys, that it is choir-practice
just going to begin.  The old man returns to his duties;
the last of the boys seem to have arrived: there are
sounds within the church and premonitory notes of the
organ; some heavy drops of the rain that has been
threatening; then in a sudden stream the shower.
</p>

<p>
From where he sits he can see far up the road beyond
the gate.  He sees a group that had been approaching
shelter beneath a distant tree.  The downpour falls in a
deluge that is fierce and short, passes and leaves the
path in puddles, and with unnoting eyes he sees the
group beneath the tree desert its shelter and come
hurrying towards the church.  The organ is playing now,
voices swing in sudden volume of sound; unheeding, as
with his eyes he is watching without seeing, he yet is
subconsciously aware of the regular rise and fall of psalms.
</p>

<p>
With his eyes unseeing!  They suddenly, as he watches,
declare to him that which sets a drumming in his head,
a snatching at his breath.  The group has reached the
gate.  It is an old man drawing a wicker bath-chair,
an old lady walking behind it.  Drumming in his head;
it passes; there succeeds to it a rocking of all the ground
about his feet, a swimming, a receding, a swift approaching
of all the land beyond the porch.  That old man
is opening the gate, turning his back to draw the bath-chair
carefully through, revealing one that sits within
it, coming on now ... coming on now ... closer and
closer and closer...
</p>

<p>
This Mr. Wriford simply stands there.  He doesn't
do anything, and he doesn't say anything.  He can't.
You see, he has been through a good deal for a good
long time.  This is the end of a long passage for him.
You know how weak he is.  You probably despise him.
Well, then, despise him now.  He has no parts, no qualities,
for this.  He makes a bungling business of it.  He
has come to the doorway of the porch and simply stands
there.  They have seen him.  They are staring at him.
They are saying things.  They are exclaiming.  He
doesn't hear.  He just stands there....
</p>

<p>
Then he begins.  He jolts down off the step of the
porch.  He stumbles along the few paces to the bath-chair.
She that is seated there gives a kind of laugh
and a kind of cry.  He falls on his knees, kneeling in
puddles, and puts his arms out, and takes her in them,
and catches her to him, and buries his face against her,
and holds her, holds her&mdash;and has nothing at all that
he can say, not even her name.
</p>

<p>
Well, nor has she.  She just has her arms about him....
When at last she speaks, Mr. and Mrs. Bickers
have gone&mdash;into the church, or into the air, or into
the ground&mdash;gone somewhere for some reason.  And
even then it is not at first speech but some odd little
sound that she makes, and at that he looks up and she
stoops to him&mdash;and there they are, her cheek against
his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"My back's a fair old caution," says Essie then.
"They don't think I'll ever walk again."
</p>

<p>
He stammers something about "I'll carry you,
dear.  I'll carry you."
</p>

<p>
Each in the other's arms, her cheek against his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Just going to Whitehouse, we were," says Essie.
"My goodness, if it hadn't rained and made us come
for shelter!"
</p>

<p>
He says something about: "It's empty&mdash;it's still
empty for us&mdash;Whitehouse."
</p>

<p>
Some one opens the church door.  Young voices and
music that have been muffled come streaming through
towards them&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord: or who shall
rise up in his holy place?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Even he that hath clean hands and a pure heart: and
that hath not lift up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn to
deceive his neighbour.</i>
</p>

<p>
A sound escapes him.  He feels a sudden moisture
from her face to his.  The singing goes deeper; then
with triumphant surge and sweep breaks out again:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye
everlasting doors....</i>"
</p>

<p>
"What, are you crying too?" says Essie.  "Aren't
we a pair of us, though?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

This is the novel that gave Mr. Hutchinson a conspicuous
place among the younger English authors who have so recently
achieved literary distinction.  It is not a sea story, as its title
would appear to indicate, but a delightful comedy of English
life, containing the most romantic of love stories, written with
such rare humor that it stands apart from the great mass of
present-day fiction.  It is a novel to read and reread, for through
all the laughter and quaintness shines the reality of life.

years.  It is a book to please every sort of reader, for it is full
of wit and wisdom.  The best praise that one can write of it,
however, is that after reading it you will want to own it, for a
desire to reread parts of it is sure to come.&mdash;<i>San Francisco Call</i>.

It is written in the highest of high spirits, in a vein of
persistent humor, and it moves along with an alertness and vivacity
that is a perpetual joy to the reader.  A new humorist as well
as a new novelist has arisen in Mr. Hutchinson.  He never fails
to be entertaining.  It is vitally and significantly
human.&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript</i>.
